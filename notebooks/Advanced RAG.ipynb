       "\"OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab founded in December 2015. It was initially co-founded by Elon Musk, along with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. OpenAI's primary goal is to develop safe and beneficial AI technologies while ensuring the broad distribution of their benefits.\\n\\nHowever, Elon Musk is no longer directly involved with OpenAI as of February 2018. Musk has stated that his departure was due to potential conflicts that might arise due to his involvement in Tesla, Neuralink, and SpaceX, where AI is also a significant focus. Despite stepping down from the board, Musk has expressed support for OpenAI and its mission.\\n\\nOpenAI has garnered attention for its innovative research and contributions in the field of artificial intelligence, including developing advanced language models such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3).\""

Y ou don’t have to be a genius to do it. Y ou just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it. No matter how much or little money you have, the important thing is to educate yourself about your opportunities. In this brochure, we’ll cover the basics on saving and investing.\\nAt the SEC, we enforce the laws that determine how in-\\nvestments are offered and sold to you. These laws protect in-vestors, but you need to do your part, too. Part of this brochure tells you how to check out investments and the people that sell them so you do not fall victim to fraud or costly mistakes.\\nNo one can guarantee that you’ll make money from \\ninvestments you make. But if you get the facts about sav -\\ning and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.\\nPlease feel free to contact us with any of your ques -\\ntions or concerns about investing. It always pays to learn before you invest.

Don’t be discouraged if \\nyou have a negative net worth. If you follow a plan to get into a positive position, you’re doing the right thing.\\nKNOW  YOUR INCOME AND EXPENSES\\nThe next step is to keep track of your income and your ex -\\npenses for every month. Write down what you and others in your family earn, and then your monthly expenses. \\nPAY  YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY FIRST\\nInclude a category for savings and investing. What are you paying yourself every month? Many people get into the habit of saving and investing by following this advice: always pay yourself or your family first. Many people find it easier to pay themselves first if they allow their bank to automatically re -\\nmove money from their paycheck and deposit it into a savings or investment account. \\nLikely even better, for tax purposes, is to participate in an \\nemployer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b). These plans will typically not only automatically de -\\nduct money from your paycheck, but will immediately reduce the taxes you are paying.

That’s probably too often. Y ou may get too caught up in the ups and downs of the “trading” value of your investment, and sell when its value goes down temporarily—even though the performance of the company is still stellar. Remember, you’re in for the long haul. \\nSome people prefer to see how they’re doing once a year. \\nThat’s probably not often enough. What’s best for you will most likely be somewhere in between, based on your goals and your investments. \\nBut it’s not enough to simply check an investment’s perfor -\\nmance. Y ou should compare that performance against an index of similar investments over the same period of time to see if you are getting the proper returns for the amount of risk that you are assuming. Y ou should also compare the fees and commissions that you’re paying to what other investment professionals charge.\\nWhile you should monitor performance regularly, you should \\npay close attention every time you send your money somewhere \\nelse to work. \\nEvery time you buy or sell an investment you will receive a \\nconfirmation slip from your broker.

And find out from your state’s securities regulator whether the investment professional or her firm have ever been dis -\\nciplined, or whether they have any complaints against them.

Still, you may be asking for serious losses if, for in -\\nstance, you invest in a small, thinly traded company that isn’t widely known solely on the basis of what you may have read online.

The best way to invest depends on your personal preferences along with your current and future financial circumstances.\\n\\nHere's a five-step process that can help you figure out how to invest your money right now:\\n\\nIdentify your financial goal and when you want to achieve that goal.\\n\\nDecide whether you want to manage your money yourself or work with a service that does it for you.\\n\\nPick the type of investment account you'll use.\\n\\nOpen an account.\\n\\nChoose your investments.\\n\\nAnd here are the details on how to put your cash to work in the right way, right away.\\n\\n» Ready to start investing? Read about the best investments right now\\n\\n1. Give your money a goal\\n\\nFiguring out how to invest money starts with determining your investing goals, when you need or want to achieve them and your comfort level with risk for each goal.\\n\\nLong-term goals: These goals are at least five years away. One common goal is retirement, but you may have others as well: Do you want a down payment on a house or college tuition? To purchase your dream vacation home or go on an anniversary trip in 10 years?\\n\\nShort-term goals: These goals are less than five years away. This is next summer's vacation, a house you want to buy next year, an emergency fund or your holiday piggy bank. Money for short-term goals generally shouldn't be invested at all. If you need the money you're saving in under five years, check out our guide to how to invest money for short-term goals.\\n\\nIn this article, we're largely focusing on investing for long-term goals. We'll also touch on how to invest with no specific goal in mind. After all, the aim to grow your money is a fine goal by itself.\\n\\n» Curious about buying stocks? Learn how to invest in the stock market.\\n\\n2. Decide how much help you want\\n\\nOnce you know your goals, you can dive into the specifics about how to invest (from picking the type of account to the best place to open an account to choosing investment vehicles). But if the DIY route doesn't sound like it'll be your cup of tea, no worries.\\n\\nMany savers prefer having someone invest their money for them. And while that used to be a pricey proposition, nowadays you may find it's surprisingly affordable to hire professional help thanks to the advent of automated portfolio management services, a.k.a. robo-advisors.\\n\\nThese online advisors use computer algorithms and advanced software to build and manage a client’s investment portfolio, offering everything from automatic rebalancing to tax optimization and even access to human help when you need it.\\n\\n» Learn more: What is a robo-advisor?\\n\\nIf you'd rather do it yourself, continue reading — we'll take you through the steps.\\n\\n3. Pick an investment account\\n\\nTo buy most types of investments, including stocks and bonds, you'll need an investment account. Just as there are a number of bank accounts for different purposes — checking, savings, money market, certificates of deposit — there are a handful of investment accounts to know about.\\n\\nSome accounts offer tax advantages if you're investing for a specific purpose, like retirement. Keep in mind that you may be taxed or penalized if you pull your money out early, or for a reason not considered qualified by the plan rules. Other accounts are general purpose and should be used for goals not related to retirement — that dream vacation home, the boat to go with it or simply a vacation, period.\\n\\nHere's a list of some of the most popular investing accounts:\\n\\nIf you're investing for retirement:\\n\\n401(k): You might already have a 401(k), which is offered by many employers and takes contributions right from your paycheck. Many companies will match your contributions, up to a limit — if yours does, you should contribute at least enough to earn that match before investing elsewhere.\\n\\nTraditional or Roth IRA: If you're already contributing to a 401(k) or don't have one, you can open an individual retirement account. In a traditional IRA, your contributions are tax-deductible but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. A Roth IRA is a cousin of the traditional version, with the opposite tax treatment: Contributions are made after-tax and do not offer upfront tax-deductibility, but money grows tax-free and distributions in retirement are not taxed. There are also retirement accounts specifically designed for self-employed people.\\n\\n» View our roundup of the best IRA providers\\n\\nIf you're investing for another goal:\\n\\nTaxable account: Sometimes called brokerage or nonqualified accounts, these are flexible investment accounts not earmarked for any specific purpose. Unlike retirement accounts, there are no rules on contribution amounts, and you can take money out at any time. These accounts don't have tax deductibility, but if you're saving for retirement and you've maxed out the above options, you can continue saving in a taxable account.\\n\\nCollege savings accounts: Like retirement accounts, these offer tax perks for saving for college. A 529 account and a Coverdell education savings account are commonly used for college savings.\\n\\nYou can open many types of non-retirement accounts at an online broker.\\n\\n» View our roundup of the best online brokers\\n\\n4. Open your account\\n\\nNow that you know what kind of account you want, you need to choose an account provider. There are two major options:\\n\\nAn online broker will allow you to self-manage your account, buying and selling a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, funds and more complex instruments. An account at an online broker is a good choice for investors who want a large selection of investment options or who prefer to be hands-on with account management. Here's how to open a brokerage account.\\n\\nA robo-advisor in a portfolio management company will use computers to do much of the work for you, building and managing a portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals. You'll pay an annual management fee for the service, generally around 0.25% to 0.50%. Robo-advisors often use funds, so they're generally not a good choice if you're interested in individual stocks or bonds. But they can be ideal for investors who prefer to be hands off.\\n\\nDon't worry if you're just getting started. Often you can open an account with no initial deposit. (See our lineup of best brokers for beginning investors.) Of course, you're not investing until you actually add money to the account, something you'll want to do regularly for the best results. You can set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your investment account, or even directly from your paycheck if your employer allows that.\\n\\n» Curious about buying stocks?

Choose investments that match your tolerance for risk\\n\\nFiguring out how to invest money involves asking where you should invest money. The answer will depend on your goals and willingness to take on more risk in exchange for higher potential investment rewards. Common investments include:\\n\\nStocks: Individual shares (piece of ownership) of companies you believe will increase in value. Learn more about stocks.\\n\\nBonds: Bonds allow a company or government to borrow your money to fund a project or refinance other debt. Bonds are considered fixed-income investments and typically make regular interest payments to investors. The principal is then returned on a set maturity date. Learn more about bonds.\\n\\nMutual funds: Investing your money in funds — like mutual funds, index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)— allows you to purchase many stocks, bonds or other investments all at once. Mutual funds build instant diversification by pooling investor money and using it to buy a basket of investments that align with the fund's stated goal. Funds may be actively managed, with a professional manager selecting the investments used, or they may track an index. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, will hold around 500 of the largest companies in the United States. Learn more about mutual funds.\\n\\nReal estate: Real estate is a way to diversify your investment portfolio outside of the traditional mix of stocks and bonds. It doesn't necessarily mean buying a home or becoming a landlord — you can invest in REITs, which are like mutual funds for real estate, or through online real estate investing platforms, which pool investor money.\\n\\nIf you have a high risk tolerance, a long time horizon and can stomach volatility, you may want a portfolio that contains mostly stocks or stock funds. If you have a low risk tolerance, you may want a portfolio that has more bonds, since these tend to be more stable and less volatile.\\n\\nYour goals are important in shaping your portfolio, too. For long-term goals, your portfolio can be more aggressive and take more risks — potentially leading to higher returns — so you may opt to own more stocks than bonds.\\n\\nWhichever route you choose, the best way to reach your long-term financial goals and minimize risk is to spread your money across a range of asset classes. That’s called asset diversification, and the proportion of dollars you put into each asset class is called asset allocation. Then within each asset class, you’ll also want to diversify into multiple investments.\\n\\nAsset diversification means owning a range of assets across a variety of industries, company sizes and geographic areas. It's important because different asset classes — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate — respond to the market differently. When one is up, another can be down. So deciding on the right mix will help your portfolio weather changing markets on the journey toward achieving your goals.\\n\\nAsset allocation is the percentage of dollars you put into each asset class. For example, let’s say based on your risk tolerance, time horizon and goals you’ve decided to allocate 90 percent of your money into stocks and 10 percent into bonds. Your asset allocation is 90/10. Within the 90 percent invested into stocks, you should diversify between large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, international stocks or value stocks.\\n\\nBuilding a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and bonds takes time and expertise, so most investors benefit from fund investing. Index funds and ETFs are typically low-cost and easy to manage, as it may take only four or five funds to build adequate diversification.\\n\\nMore resources on investing\\n\\nNow you know the investing basics, and you have some money you want to invest.

       " 'raw_content': 'Your Cart\\nMaking Smart Investments: A Beginner’s Guide\\nIf you make smart decisions and invest in the right places, you can reduce the risk factor, increase the reward factor, and generate meaningful returns.\\xa0Here are a few questions to consider as you get started.\\nWhere your work meets your life. See more from Ascend here.\\nAre you a saver or spender?\\nIf you went with the former, then you’re in the majority. According to a 2019 Charles Schwab survey, around 59% of Americans said they considered themselves\\xa0savers. Compare that to more recent findings, however, and you’ll see\\xa0that\\xa063% of respondents\\xa0in a similar demographic are currently living paycheck to paycheck.\\nClearly, there’s a disconnect between the financial goals we are setting and the steps we are taking to realize them.\\nMany of us are taught from a young age that saving is the most direct path to building wealth and achieving financial freedom. But this is a myth. While saving is key in the pursuit of both goals, making smart investments with your money makes them much more attainable.\\nThe fear that stops most people from investing is a reasonable one: financial loss as opposed to financial gain. When we work hard and are disciplined enough to forgo consumption and save, the idea of losing our hard-earned dollars understandably makes us uncomfortable. As a result, we tuck our money away in an FDIC-insured bank account.\\nHere’s the problem: The money we put into our accounts is almost guaranteed to lose value. The low interest rates that savings accounts offer can’t even keep pace with inflation, meaning our money’s purchasing power decreases the longer we save.\\nThere is some good news, though. If you make smart decisions and invest in the right places, you can reduce the risk factor, increase the reward factor, and generate meaningful returns without feeling like you’d be better off in Vegas.\\nHere are a few questions to consider as you get started.\\nWhy should you invest?\\nSaving versus investing is an oft-heard debate in financial circles. But they’re two sides of the same coin.\\nWhen building wealth, saving is an indispensable part of the financial toolbox — not because it produces wealth on its own, but because it provides the capital necessary\\xa0to\\xa0invest. At a minimum, investing allows you to keep pace with cost-of-living increases created by inflation.\\xa0At a maximum, the major benefit of a long-term investment strategy is the possibility of compounding interest, or growth earned on growth.\\nHow much should you save vs. invest?\\nGiven that each investor enters the market because of unique circumstances, the best answer to how much you should save is “as much as possible.” As a guideline,\\xa0saving 20% of your income is the right starting place. More is always better, but I believe that 20% allows you to accumulate a meaningful amount of capital throughout your career.\\nInitially, you’ll want to allocate these savings to building an emergency fund equal to roughly three to six months’ worth of ordinary expenses. Once you’ve socked away these emergency savings, invest additional funds that aren’t being put toward specific near-term expenses.\\nInvested wisely — and over a long period — this capital can multiply.\\nHow do investments work?\\nUnderstanding the market:\\xa0In the finance world, the market is a term used to describe the place where you can buy and sell shares of stocks, bonds, and other assets. To enter the market, don’t use your bank account.\\nYou need to open an investment account, like a brokerage account, which you fund with cash that you can then use to buy stocks, bonds, and other investable assets. Big-name firms like Schwab or Fidelity will let you do this similarly to how you’d open a bank account.\\nStocks vs. bonds:\\xa0Publicly traded companies use the market to raise money for their operations, growth, or expansion by issuing stocks (small pieces of ownership of the company) or bonds (debt).\\nWhen a company issues bonds on the market, they are basically asking investors for loans to raise money for their organization. Investors buy the bonds, then the company pays them back, plus a percentage of interest, over time.\\nStocks, on the other hand, are small pieces of equity in a company. When a company goes from private to public, its stock can be publicly bought and sold on the market — meaning it is no longer privately owned. A stock price is generally reflective of the value of the company, but the actual price is determined by what market participants are willing to pay or accept on any given day.\\nOther Types of Investments\\nYou’re not limited to stocks and bonds, though. You can buy commodities, precious metals, investment real estate, or foreign stocks and bonds in the market. There are also mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are collections of stocks, bonds, or other assets that you can purchase shares in; one share of a mutual fund reflects a tiny percentage ownership of a number of assets. Regardless of what type of investment you choose, you buy shares of it through your brokerage (or other) account.\\nStocks are considered riskier investments than bonds because of this price volatility. If bad news comes out about a company, people may want to pay less to buy shares than they did before, which will lower the stock price. If you bought the stock for a large sum of money, you risk losing that money if the stock price drops.\\nStocks are also riskier because when companies go bankrupt, bondholders receive their money back — stockholders have no such guarantee.\\nMaking (and losing) money:\\xa0In the market, you make or lose money depending on the purchase and sale price of whatever you buy. If you buy a stock at $10 and sell it at $15, you make $5. If you buy at $15 and sell at $10, you lose $5. Gains and losses are only “realized” or counted when you make the sale of the asset — so the stock you bought at $10 could drop to $6, but you’ll only “lose” the $4 if you sell the stock at $6. Maybe you wait a year and then sell the stock when it’s up to $11, thereby gaining $1 per share.\\nAre you investing reasonably?\\nNow that you understand how investing works, it’s time to think about where you want to put your money. As a rule of thumb, remember that the best risk an investor can take is a calculated one.\\nBut how can you be calculated? How can you distinguish a smart investment from a risky investment? Truthfully, “smart” and “risky” are relative to every investor. Your circumstances (e.g., age, amount of debt, family status) or\\xa0risk tolerance\\xa0can help you identify where you fall on the risk spectrum.\\nIn general, younger investors with many years before retirement should have riskier portfolios. That longer time horizon gives investors more years to weather the ups and downs of the market — and during their working years, investors are ideally just adding to their investment accounts rather than taking money out.\\nSomeone at or near retirement, however, is much more vulnerable to changes in the market. If you use an investment account to cover your living expenses, you could be forced to take that money out of the account during a downturn in the market, which would not only shrink your portfolio but also could ensure significant investment losses.\\nA higher-risk portfolio would likely encompass a significant number of stocks and fewer (if any) bonds. As young investors grow older and need to reduce the risk in their portfolios, they should reduce their investment in stocks and increase their investment in bonds.\\nThe ebb and flow of life will influence your investments more than you may realize. Being realistic about your current financial prospects will keep you clearheaded about where to invest your money.\\nAre you building wealth that lasts?\\nLarger-than-average returns almost always require you to take larger-than-average risks, and there are no free lunches in investing.\\xa0As you work to build wealth and secure your financial future, stay focused on three long-term investment musts:\\nBuild a “just in case” nest egg:\\xa0Nearly one-quarter of Americans\\xa0have no emergency savings. Don’t let yourself get caught in that trap. Retirement savings accounts are critical savings vehicles, but tapping into them before retirement typically brings steep tax penalties. To prevent this from happening, build an emergency fund — as described earlier — that amounts to roughly three to six months of your living expenses.\\nOne of the most significant things you can do for your financial future is to make saving automatic — that is, have your bank automatically direct a portion of your paycheck into an account specifically for saving. This ensures you save consistently instead of forcing you to make an active choice to set money aside.\\nThis sum should stay somewhere with low risk like a bank account, and it should remain\\xa0liquid (i.e., cash or something else that’s always available to you)\\xa0to ensure you can access it if you ever need it. Once you’ve established an emergency fund, invest future savings based on your risk tolerance.\\nSteer savings in the right direction:\\xa0Generally, you’ll want to start by deciding what percentage of your assets you want to be in riskier assets (stocks/shares) and what percentage you want in safer assets (cash and bonds). This depends on your risk tolerance, as outlined above. Somebody young and working should be almost all in stocks, while somebody near retirement age should have a healthier allocation to bonds.\\nIf you’re just starting to invest, I believe you should look at mutual funds or ETFs (i.e., a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles) rather than individual stocks (i.e., ownership in only one company) because it will be easier to create a diversified account using funds if the account in question is small.\\nDiversification (owning a variety of assets) is important because it lessens the chance that your whole portfolio will lose value in a market downturn. You’ll want to find funds with solid track records and reasonable fees; plenty of popular press and dedicated research sites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance will provide this information.\\nWhen you’re ready to start investing in individual stocks, you’ll want to do the same kind of research on any companies you consider: Do they have good track records? Do they have good management? Is the stock price reasonable? Does it add diversification to your portfolio, or is it similar to what you already hold? Spend some time on this step to ensure you’re making informed investment choices.\\nMake variety a theme of your investments:\\xa0Diversifying across your entire investment “portfolio” (i.e., all of the investments you hold)\\xa0is critical to building wealth because it allows you to manage risk more effectively. Stocks are one of the most talked-about investments, but you wouldn’t want to tie your entire financial future to the success of a single company — or even any broader market.\\nDepending on your financial circumstances and risk tolerance, you might want to consider investing in private equity, venture capital, precious metals, commodities, and real estate, all of which are available on the market. All these investments can be effective means to achieve portfolio diversification and manage risk.\\nWhy? Because they rely on different underlying drivers. This means they generally operate in ways that are uncorrelated with each other and with more traditional investments like stocks and bonds, so they may be going up when stocks are going down.\\nA well-constructed portfolio should include several different types of assets (meaning stocks, bonds, etc.) that do not move in tandem. This reduces the volatility of a portfolio without necessarily lowering its return potential.\\nWhile these steps alone will not guarantee you complete financial independence, I believe they’re a great starting point. They can help you amass savings, achieve portfolio diversification, and empower you to start building wealth for a better financial future.\\nPartner Center'}"
