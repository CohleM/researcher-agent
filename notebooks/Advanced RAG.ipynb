Credit cards can make it seem easy to buy expensive \\nthings when you don’t have the cash in your pocket—or in the \\nbank.

Pay as much \\nas you can toward that debt each month until your balance is once \\nagain zero, while still paying the minimum on your other cards.\\nThe same advice goes for any other high interest debt (about 8% or \\nabove) which does not offer the tax advantages of, for example, a mortgage.\\nNow, once you have paid off those credit cards and begun to \\nset aside some money to save and invest, what are your choices?', metadata={'source': 'Resources/sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

It’s important that you \\ngo into any investment in stocks, bonds or mutual funds with a \\nfull understanding that you could lose some or all of your money \\nin any one investment. While over the long term the stock market \\nhas historically provided around 10% annual returns (closer to 6% \\nor 7% “real” returns when you subtract for the effects of inflation), \\nthe long term does sometimes take a rather long, long time to play \\nout.

A frequent mistake \\npeople make is putting money they will not need for a very \\nlong time in investments that pay a low amount of interest. \\nOn the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, \\nfive years or less, you don’t want to choose risky investments, \\nbecause when it’s time to sell, you may have to take a loss.

But you also \\nmay see the stock increase in value beyond what you could \\nearn from the bonds. If you buy the stock, you become an \\n“owner” of the company.\\nY ou wrestle with the decision. If you buy the bonds, you \\nwill get your money back plus the 8% interest a year. And you \\nthink the company will be able to honor its promise to you on \\nthe bonds because it has been in business for many years and \\ndoesn’t look like it could go bankrupt.

If two funds are similar in every way except that one charges a higher fee than the other, you’ll make more money by choosing the fund with the lower annual costs.\\nFor more information about mutual fund and ETF fees and  \\nexpenses, be sure to read our brochure entitled “Mutual Funds and ETFs—A Guide for Investors”—which you can read online at  \\nInvestor.gov. \\nMUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFs  WITHOUT ACTIVE \\nMANAGEMENT\\nOne way that investors can obtain for themselves nearly the full returns of the market is to invest in an “index fund.” This is a fund that does not attempt to pick and choose stocks of indi -\\nvidual companies based upon the research of the fund managers or to try to time the market’s movements. An index fund seeks to equal the returns of a major stock index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, the Wilshire 5000, or the Russell 3000.

Funds that trade quickly in and out of stocks \\nwill have what is known as “high turnover.” While selling a \\nstock that has moved up in price does lock in a profit for the \\nfund, this is a profit for which taxes have to be paid. Turnover \\nin a fund creates taxable capital gains, which are paid by the \\nfund shareholders. All funds are now mandated by the SEC to \\nshow both their before- and after-tax returns. The differences \\nbetween what a fund is reportedly earning, and what a fund is \\nearning after taxes are paid on the dividends and capital gains, \\ncan be quite striking. If you plan to hold funds in a taxable \\n account, be sure to check out these historical returns in the \\nfund prospectus to see what kind of taxes you might be likely \\nto incur.\\nDo I Need an Investment Professional?\\nAre you the type of person who will read as much as possible \\nabout potential investments and ask questions about them?

The best way to invest depends on your personal preferences along with your current and future financial circumstances.\\n\\nHere's a five-step process that can help you figure out how to invest your money right now:\\n\\nIdentify your financial goal and when you want to achieve that goal.\\n\\nDecide whether you want to manage your money yourself or work with a service that does it for you.\\n\\nPick the type of investment account you'll use.\\n\\nOpen an account.\\n\\nChoose your investments.\\n\\nAnd here are the details on how to put your cash to work in the right way, right away.\\n\\n» Ready to start investing? Read about the best investments right now\\n\\n1. Give your money a goal\\n\\nFiguring out how to invest money starts with determining your investing goals, when you need or want to achieve them and your comfort level with risk for each goal.\\n\\nLong-term goals: These goals are at least five years away. One common goal is retirement, but you may have others as well: Do you want a down payment on a house or college tuition? To purchase your dream vacation home or go on an anniversary trip in 10 years?\\n\\nShort-term goals: These goals are less than five years away. This is next summer's vacation, a house you want to buy next year, an emergency fund or your holiday piggy bank. Money for short-term goals generally shouldn't be invested at all. If you need the money you're saving in under five years, check out our guide to how to invest money for short-term goals.\\n\\nIn this article, we're largely focusing on investing for long-term goals. We'll also touch on how to invest with no specific goal in mind. After all, the aim to grow your money is a fine goal by itself.\\n\\n» Curious about buying stocks? Learn how to invest in the stock market.\\n\\n2. Decide how much help you want\\n\\nOnce you know your goals, you can dive into the specifics about how to invest (from picking the type of account to the best place to open an account to choosing investment vehicles). But if the DIY route doesn't sound like it'll be your cup of tea, no worries.\\n\\nMany savers prefer having someone invest their money for them. And while that used to be a pricey proposition, nowadays you may find it's surprisingly affordable to hire professional help thanks to the advent of automated portfolio management services, a.k.a. robo-advisors.\\n\\nThese online advisors use computer algorithms and advanced software to build and manage a client’s investment portfolio, offering everything from automatic rebalancing to tax optimization and even access to human help when you need it.\\n\\n» Learn more: What is a robo-advisor?\\n\\nIf you'd rather do it yourself, continue reading — we'll take you through the steps.\\n\\n3. Pick an investment account\\n\\nTo buy most types of investments, including stocks and bonds, you'll need an investment account. Just as there are a number of bank accounts for different purposes — checking, savings, money market, certificates of deposit — there are a handful of investment accounts to know about.\\n\\nSome accounts offer tax advantages if you're investing for a specific purpose, like retirement. Keep in mind that you may be taxed or penalized if you pull your money out early, or for a reason not considered qualified by the plan rules. Other accounts are general purpose and should be used for goals not related to retirement — that dream vacation home, the boat to go with it or simply a vacation, period.\\n\\nHere's a list of some of the most popular investing accounts:\\n\\nIf you're investing for retirement:\\n\\n401(k): You might already have a 401(k), which is offered by many employers and takes contributions right from your paycheck. Many companies will match your contributions, up to a limit — if yours does, you should contribute at least enough to earn that match before investing elsewhere.\\n\\nTraditional or Roth IRA: If you're already contributing to a 401(k) or don't have one, you can open an individual retirement account. In a traditional IRA, your contributions are tax-deductible but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. A Roth IRA is a cousin of the traditional version, with the opposite tax treatment: Contributions are made after-tax and do not offer upfront tax-deductibility, but money grows tax-free and distributions in retirement are not taxed. There are also retirement accounts specifically designed for self-employed people.\\n\\n» View our roundup of the best IRA providers\\n\\nIf you're investing for another goal:\\n\\nTaxable account: Sometimes called brokerage or nonqualified accounts, these are flexible investment accounts not earmarked for any specific purpose. Unlike retirement accounts, there are no rules on contribution amounts, and you can take money out at any time. These accounts don't have tax deductibility, but if you're saving for retirement and you've maxed out the above options, you can continue saving in a taxable account.\\n\\nCollege savings accounts: Like retirement accounts, these offer tax perks for saving for college. A 529 account and a Coverdell education savings account are commonly used for college savings.\\n\\nYou can open many types of non-retirement accounts at an online broker.\\n\\n» View our roundup of the best online brokers\\n\\n4. Open your account\\n\\nNow that you know what kind of account you want, you need to choose an account provider. There are two major options:\\n\\nAn online broker will allow you to self-manage your account, buying and selling a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, funds and more complex instruments. An account at an online broker is a good choice for investors who want a large selection of investment options or who prefer to be hands-on with account management. Here's how to open a brokerage account.\\n\\nA robo-advisor in a portfolio management company will use computers to do much of the work for you, building and managing a portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals. You'll pay an annual management fee for the service, generally around 0.25% to 0.50%. Robo-advisors often use funds, so they're generally not a good choice if you're interested in individual stocks or bonds. But they can be ideal for investors who prefer to be hands off.\\n\\nDon't worry if you're just getting started. Often you can open an account with no initial deposit. (See our lineup of best brokers for beginning investors.) Of course, you're not investing until you actually add money to the account, something you'll want to do regularly for the best results. You can set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your investment account, or even directly from your paycheck if your employer allows that.\\n\\n» Curious about buying stocks? Learn how to invest in the stock market.\\n\\nNerd out on investing news\\n\\nSubscribe to our monthly investing newsletter for our nerdy take on the stock market.\\n\\nSIGN UP\\n\\n5. Choose investments that match your tolerance for risk\\n\\nFiguring out how to invest money involves asking where you should invest money. The answer will depend on your goals and willingness to take on more risk in exchange for higher potential investment rewards. Common investments include:\\n\\nStocks: Individual shares (piece of ownership) of companies you believe will increase in value. Learn more about stocks.\\n\\nBonds: Bonds allow a company or government to borrow your money to fund a project or refinance other debt. Bonds are considered fixed-income investments and typically make regular interest payments to investors. The principal is then returned on a set maturity date. Learn more about bonds.\\n\\nMutual funds: Investing your money in funds — like mutual funds, index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)— allows you to purchase many stocks, bonds or other investments all at once. Mutual funds build instant diversification by pooling investor money and using it to buy a basket of investments that align with the fund's stated goal. Funds may be actively managed, with a professional manager selecting the investments used, or they may track an index. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, will hold around 500 of the largest companies in the United States. Learn more about mutual funds.\\n\\nReal estate: Real estate is a way to diversify your investment portfolio outside of the traditional mix of stocks and bonds. It doesn't necessarily mean buying a home or becoming a landlord — you can invest in REITs, which are like mutual funds for real estate, or through online real estate investing platforms, which pool investor money.\\n\\nIf you have a high risk tolerance, a long time horizon and can stomach volatility, you may want a portfolio that contains mostly stocks or stock funds. If you have a low risk tolerance, you may want a portfolio that has more bonds, since these tend to be more stable and less volatile.\\n\\nYour goals are important in shaping your portfolio, too. For long-term goals, your portfolio can be more aggressive and take more risks — potentially leading to higher returns — so you may opt to own more stocks than bonds.\\n\\nWhichever route you choose, the best way to reach your long-term financial goals and minimize risk is to spread your money across a range of asset classes. That’s called asset diversification, and the proportion of dollars you put into each asset class is called asset allocation. Then within each asset class, you’ll also want to diversify into multiple investments.\\n\\nAsset diversification means owning a range of assets across a variety of industries, company sizes and geographic areas. It's important because different asset classes — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate — respond to the market differently. When one is up, another can be down. So deciding on the right mix will help your portfolio weather changing markets on the journey toward achieving your goals.\\n\\nAsset allocation is the percentage of dollars you put into each asset class. For example, let’s say based on your risk tolerance, time horizon and goals you’ve decided to allocate 90 percent of your money into stocks and 10 percent into bonds. Your asset allocation is 90/10. Within the 90 percent invested into stocks, you should diversify between large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, international stocks or value stocks.\\n\\nBuilding a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and bonds takes time and expertise, so most investors benefit from fund investing. Index funds and ETFs are typically low-cost and easy to manage, as it may take only four or five funds to build adequate diversification.\\n\\nMore resources on investing\\n\\nNow you know the investing basics, and you have some money you want to invest.

       " 'raw_content': 'Your Cart\\nMaking Smart Investments: A Beginner’s Guide\\nIf you make smart decisions and invest in the right places, you can reduce the risk factor, increase the reward factor, and generate meaningful returns.\\xa0Here are a few questions to consider as you get started.\\nWhere your work meets your life. See more from Ascend here.\\nAre you a saver or spender?\\nIf you went with the former, then you’re in the majority. According to a 2019 Charles Schwab survey, around 59% of Americans said they considered themselves\\xa0savers. Compare that to more recent findings, however, and you’ll see\\xa0that\\xa063% of respondents\\xa0in a similar demographic are currently living paycheck to paycheck.\\nClearly, there’s a disconnect between the financial goals we are setting and the steps we are taking to realize them.\\nMany of us are taught from a young age that saving is the most direct path to building wealth and achieving financial freedom. But this is a myth. While saving is key in the pursuit of both goals, making smart investments with your money makes them much more attainable.\\nThe fear that stops most people from investing is a reasonable one: financial loss as opposed to financial gain. When we work hard and are disciplined enough to forgo consumption and save, the idea of losing our hard-earned dollars understandably makes us uncomfortable. As a result, we tuck our money away in an FDIC-insured bank account.\\nHere’s the problem: The money we put into our accounts is almost guaranteed to lose value. The low interest rates that savings accounts offer can’t even keep pace with inflation, meaning our money’s purchasing power decreases the longer we save.\\nThere is some good news, though. If you make smart decisions and invest in the right places, you can reduce the risk factor, increase the reward factor, and generate meaningful returns without feeling like you’d be better off in Vegas.\\nHere are a few questions to consider as you get started.\\nWhy should you invest?\\nSaving versus investing is an oft-heard debate in financial circles. But they’re two sides of the same coin.\\nWhen building wealth, saving is an indispensable part of the financial toolbox — not because it produces wealth on its own, but because it provides the capital necessary\\xa0to\\xa0invest. At a minimum, investing allows you to keep pace with cost-of-living increases created by inflation.\\xa0At a maximum, the major benefit of a long-term investment strategy is the possibility of compounding interest, or growth earned on growth.\\nHow much should you save vs. invest?\\nGiven that each investor enters the market because of unique circumstances, the best answer to how much you should save is “as much as possible.” As a guideline,\\xa0saving 20% of your income is the right starting place. More is always better, but I believe that 20% allows you to accumulate a meaningful amount of capital throughout your career.\\nInitially, you’ll want to allocate these savings to building an emergency fund equal to roughly three to six months’ worth of ordinary expenses. Once you’ve socked away these emergency savings, invest additional funds that aren’t being put toward specific near-term expenses.\\nInvested wisely — and over a long period — this capital can multiply.\\nHow do investments work?\\nUnderstanding the market:\\xa0In the finance world, the market is a term used to describe the place where you can buy and sell shares of stocks, bonds, and other assets. To enter the market, don’t use your bank account.\\nYou need to open an investment account, like a brokerage account, which you fund with cash that you can then use to buy stocks, bonds, and other investable assets. Big-name firms like Schwab or Fidelity will let you do this similarly to how you’d open a bank account.\\nStocks vs. bonds:\\xa0Publicly traded companies use the market to raise money for their operations, growth, or expansion by issuing stocks (small pieces of ownership of the company) or bonds (debt).\\nWhen a company issues bonds on the market, they are basically asking investors for loans to raise money for their organization. Investors buy the bonds, then the company pays them back, plus a percentage of interest, over time.\\nStocks, on the other hand, are small pieces of equity in a company. When a company goes from private to public, its stock can be publicly bought and sold on the market — meaning it is no longer privately owned. A stock price is generally reflective of the value of the company, but the actual price is determined by what market participants are willing to pay or accept on any given day.\\nOther Types of Investments\\nYou’re not limited to stocks and bonds, though. You can buy commodities, precious metals, investment real estate, or foreign stocks and bonds in the market. There are also mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are collections of stocks, bonds, or other assets that you can purchase shares in; one share of a mutual fund reflects a tiny percentage ownership of a number of assets. Regardless of what type of investment you choose, you buy shares of it through your brokerage (or other) account.\\nStocks are considered riskier investments than bonds because of this price volatility. If bad news comes out about a company, people may want to pay less to buy shares than they did before, which will lower the stock price. If you bought the stock for a large sum of money, you risk losing that money if the stock price drops.\\nStocks are also riskier because when companies go bankrupt, bondholders receive their money back — stockholders have no such guarantee.\\nMaking (and losing) money:\\xa0In the market, you make or lose money depending on the purchase and sale price of whatever you buy. If you buy a stock at $10 and sell it at $15, you make $5. If you buy at $15 and sell at $10, you lose $5. Gains and losses are only “realized” or counted when you make the sale of the asset — so the stock you bought at $10 could drop to $6, but you’ll only “lose” the $4 if you sell the stock at $6. Maybe you wait a year and then sell the stock when it’s up to $11, thereby gaining $1 per share.\\nAre you investing reasonably?\\nNow that you understand how investing works, it’s time to think about where you want to put your money. As a rule of thumb, remember that the best risk an investor can take is a calculated one.\\nBut how can you be calculated? How can you distinguish a smart investment from a risky investment? Truthfully, “smart” and “risky” are relative to every investor. Your circumstances (e.g., age, amount of debt, family status) or\\xa0risk tolerance\\xa0can help you identify where you fall on the risk spectrum.\\nIn general, younger investors with many years before retirement should have riskier portfolios. That longer time horizon gives investors more years to weather the ups and downs of the market — and during their working years, investors are ideally just adding to their investment accounts rather than taking money out.\\nSomeone at or near retirement, however, is much more vulnerable to changes in the market. If you use an investment account to cover your living expenses, you could be forced to take that money out of the account during a downturn in the market, which would not only shrink your portfolio but also could ensure significant investment losses.\\nA higher-risk portfolio would likely encompass a significant number of stocks and fewer (if any) bonds. As young investors grow older and need to reduce the risk in their portfolios, they should reduce their investment in stocks and increase their investment in bonds.\\nThe ebb and flow of life will influence your investments more than you may realize. Being realistic about your current financial prospects will keep you clearheaded about where to invest your money.\\nAre you building wealth that lasts?\\nLarger-than-average returns almost always require you to take larger-than-average risks, and there are no free lunches in investing.\\xa0As you work to build wealth and secure your financial future, stay focused on three long-term investment musts:\\nBuild a “just in case” nest egg:\\xa0Nearly one-quarter of Americans\\xa0have no emergency savings. Don’t let yourself get caught in that trap. Retirement savings accounts are critical savings vehicles, but tapping into them before retirement typically brings steep tax penalties. To prevent this from happening, build an emergency fund — as described earlier — that amounts to roughly three to six months of your living expenses.\\nOne of the most significant things you can do for your financial future is to make saving automatic — that is, have your bank automatically direct a portion of your paycheck into an account specifically for saving. This ensures you save consistently instead of forcing you to make an active choice to set money aside.\\nThis sum should stay somewhere with low risk like a bank account, and it should remain\\xa0liquid (i.e., cash or something else that’s always available to you)\\xa0to ensure you can access it if you ever need it. Once you’ve established an emergency fund, invest future savings based on your risk tolerance.\\nSteer savings in the right direction:\\xa0Generally, you’ll want to start by deciding what percentage of your assets you want to be in riskier assets (stocks/shares) and what percentage you want in safer assets (cash and bonds). This depends on your risk tolerance, as outlined above. Somebody young and working should be almost all in stocks, while somebody near retirement age should have a healthier allocation to bonds.\\nIf you’re just starting to invest, I believe you should look at mutual funds or ETFs (i.e., a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles) rather than individual stocks (i.e., ownership in only one company) because it will be easier to create a diversified account using funds if the account in question is small.\\nDiversification (owning a variety of assets) is important because it lessens the chance that your whole portfolio will lose value in a market downturn. You’ll want to find funds with solid track records and reasonable fees; plenty of popular press and dedicated research sites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance will provide this information.\\nWhen you’re ready to start investing in individual stocks, you’ll want to do the same kind of research on any companies you consider: Do they have good track records? Do they have good management? Is the stock price reasonable? Does it add diversification to your portfolio, or is it similar to what you already hold? Spend some time on this step to ensure you’re making informed investment choices.\\nMake variety a theme of your investments:\\xa0Diversifying across your entire investment “portfolio” (i.e., all of the investments you hold)\\xa0is critical to building wealth because it allows you to manage risk more effectively. Stocks are one of the most talked-about investments, but you wouldn’t want to tie your entire financial future to the success of a single company — or even any broader market.\\nDepending on your financial circumstances and risk tolerance, you might want to consider investing in private equity, venture capital, precious metals, commodities, and real estate, all of which are available on the market. All these investments can be effective means to achieve portfolio diversification and manage risk.\\nWhy? Because they rely on different underlying drivers. This means they generally operate in ways that are uncorrelated with each other and with more traditional investments like stocks and bonds, so they may be going up when stocks are going down.\\nA well-constructed portfolio should include several different types of assets (meaning stocks, bonds, etc.) that do not move in tandem. This reduces the volatility of a portfolio without necessarily lowering its return potential.\\nWhile these steps alone will not guarantee you complete financial independence, I believe they’re a great starting point. They can help you amass savings, achieve portfolio diversification, and empower you to start building wealth for a better financial future.\\nPartner Center'}"

For instance, STEP-BACK PROMPTING\\nimproves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and\\n11%, TimeQA by 27%, and MuSiQue by 7%.\\nThe purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be\\nabsolutely precise. — Edsger W.

Scaling up the model size and pre-training\\ncorpus (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has brought remarkable improvement in model\\ncapabilities and sample efficiency with insights from the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\\net al., 2022), as well as emergent abilities (Wei et al., 2022a) such as multi-step reasoning (Wei et al.,\\n2022b; Zhou et al., 2022) and instruction following (Mishra et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2021).\\nFigure 1: Strong Performance of STEP-BACK PROMPTING: our proposed Abstraction-and-Reasoning\\nscheme leads to a substantial improvement in a wide range of challenging tasks in STEM, Knowledge\\nQA and Multi-Hop Reasoning requiring complex (often multi-hop) reasoning.\\n∗Equal Contribution\\n1\\narXiv:2310.06117v1  [cs.LG]  9 Oct 2023\\n', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'file_path': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 36, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'modDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models\\nDespite the great advancements, complex multi-step reasoning remains challenging for even the state-\\nof-the-art LLMs. Lightman et al.

For example, Kepler\\ncompressed thousands of measurements into Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion which precisely\\ndescribe the orbits of planets around the Sun (Russell, 1964). In critical decision making, humans\\nfind abstraction to be helpful since it provides a broader view of the environment. This work explores\\nhow LLMs can tackle complex tasks involving many low-level details through a two-step process\\nof abstraction-and-reasoning. The first step is to teach LLMs to step back, and derive high-level\\nabstractions such as concepts and first principles from the specific example. The second step is to\\nleverage the reasoning ability to ground the solution on the high-level concepts and first principles.\\nWe use few-shot exemplar demonstrations to execute STEP-BACK PROMPTING on LLMs.\\nWe experiment across a range of tasks involving domain specific reasoning such as Physics and Chem-\\nistry, knowledge-intensive question answering requiring factual knowledge, multi-hop commonsense\\nreasoning.

Figure 1 shows a\\nsummary of all the key results presented in this paper. Some the tasks are very challenging: both\\nPaLM-2L and GPT-4 achieve only ∼ 40% accuracy on TimeQA and MuSiQue. Chain-of-Thought\\nprompting leads to a minor improvement on a few tasks, while STEP-BACK PROMPTING improves\\nthe performance of PaLM-2L across the board: 7% and 11% on MMLU Physics and Chemistry, 27%\\non TimeQA, and 7% on MuSiQue.\\nWe conduct a variety of analysis and find that STEP-BACK PROMPTING has strong performance\\nimprovements (up to 36%) over chain of thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and take a\\ndeep breathe (TDB) prompting (Yang et al., 2023). We perform a qualitative evaluation where we\\nfind that Step-Back fixes a large portion of errors of the base model (up to ∼ 40%) while introducing\\na small portion of new errors (max ∼ 12%). We also conduct an error analysis and find that majority\\nof the errors made by STEP-BACK PROMPTING is attributed to the intrinsic limitations of reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs while abstraction skills are relatively easy to teach LLMs, pointing out the\\ndirection for future improvements of methods alike STEP-BACK PROMPTING.\\n2\\nSTEP-BACK PROMPTING\\nSTEP-BACK PROMPTING is motivated by the observation that many tasks contain a lot of details,\\nand are hard for LLMs to retrieve relevant facts to tackle the task. As shown in the first example\\n(top) in Figure 2, for a Physics question of “What happens to the pressure, P, of an ideal gas if the\\ntemperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8 ?”, the LLM can\\ndeviate from the first principle of Ideal Gas Law when reasoning directly on the question. Similarly, a\\nquestion of “Estella Leopold went to which school between Aug 1954 and Nov 1954?” is very hard to\\naddress directly given the detailed time range constraint. In both cases, taking a step back and asking\\na step-back question helps model to solve the problem effectively.\\nWe define a step-back question as a derived question from the original question at a higher-level of\\nabstraction. For instance, instead of directly asking “which school Estella Leopold went to during a\\nspecific period”, a step-back question (Figure 2 bottom) would ask about the “education history”,\\nwhich is a high-level concept encompasses the original question. Answering the step-back question\\nof “Estella Leopold’s education history” in this case will provide all the necessary information to\\nreason about “which school Estella Leopold went to during a specific period”. The premise is that\\nmore often the step-back question is much easier to address than the original question. Grounding the\\nreasoning on top of such abstractions helps to avoid reasoning errors in the intermediate steps such as\\nthe example shown in Figure 2 (left) from Chain-of-Thought. In short, STEP-BACK PROMPTING\\nconsists two simple steps:\\n• Abstraction: Instead of addressing the question directly, we first prompt the LLM to ask a generic\\nstep-back question about a higher-level concept or principles, and retrieve relevant facts about the\\nhigh-level concept or principles.\\n• Reasoning: Grounded on the facts regarding high-level concept or principles, the LLM can reason\\nabout the solution to the original question. We term this Abstraction-grounded Reasoning.\\nIn the following sections, we present an empirical study of STEP-BACK PROMPTING on a range of\\nchallenging tasks covering STEM, Knowledge QA and Multi-Hop Reasoning involving complex\\nreasoning.\\n3\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nHere we define the tasks and models we experiment with. We also describe our evaluation metric and\\nthe baselines we consider.\\n3.1\\nTASKS\\nWe experiment with the following diverse tasks: (a) STEM, (b) Knowledge QA and (c) Multi-Hop\\nReasoning.

We first teach the LLMs to do Abstraction. The step-back\\nquestion “What was Estella Leopold’s education history” in Figure 2 is generated by the LLM through\\nfew-shot demonstrations (see Appendix D.2 for details). Given the knowledge-intensive nature of\\nthese queries, we use retrieval augmentation (RAG) in combination with STEP-BACK PROMPTING.\\nThe step-back question is used to retrieve relevant facts, which works as additional context (see\\nTable 12 for the prompting template) to ground the final reasoning step.\\n5.2\\nRESULTS\\nWe evaluate the models on the test-set of TimeQA. As shown in Table 2, the baseline models of\\nGPT-4 and PaLM-2L achieved 45.6% and 41.5%, highlighting the difficulty of the task. Applying\\neither CoT or TDB zero-shot (and one-shot) prompting to the baseline model shows no improvement.\\nIn contrast, augmenting the baseline model by regular retrieval augmentation (RAG) improves the\\naccuracy to 57.4%, highlighting the factual intensive nature of the task. The result of Step-Back\\n+ RAG shows the effectiveness of going back to a high-level concept, which enables much more\\nreliable retrieval augmentation: the accuracy on TimeQA achieves a remarkable 68.7%.\\nNext, we segment TimeQA into the Easy and Hard difficulty level provided in the original dataset.\\nAs expected, all methods perform worse on the Hard segment. While RAG can improve the Easy\\naccuracy from 42.6% to 67.8%, the improvement is much smaller on the Hard accuracy: 40.4% to\\n46.8%. This is where STEP-BACK PROMPTING really shines by retrieving facts regarding high-level\\nconcepts to ground the final reasoning: Step-Back + RAG further improves the Hard accuracy to\\n62.3%, outperforming 42.6% from GPT-4. We hypothesis that facts regarding the high-level concepts\\n(such as education history) is much more accessible than the low-level details.\\nOn the SituatedQA benchmark, we observe a moderate quality gain from 54.3% to our best method\\nof Step-Back + RAG 61% with a small gap to GPT-4’s 63.2%.

Baseline\\nperformance of PaLM-2L and GPT4 are low (35.5% and 38.5% for PaLM-2L and GPT-4 respectively)\\nin MuSiQue since it is a hard multihop reasoning behchmark. In contrast, StartegyQA has stronger\\nbaselines (82.8% and 78.3% for PaLM-2L and GPT4 respectively) probably because of the binary\\nclassification task. CoT and TDB improve model performance a bit in case of MuSiQue (∼ 3% and\\n3.5% respectively) which can be attributed to the inherent reasoning nature of this task where these\\nmethods are shown to be helpful. In case of StrategyQA, there is no signficant performance gain with\\nCOT and TDB which could be due to the high baseline performance in this task, with limited scope\\nfor these prompting methods to improve performance. Often, 1-shot performance is significantly\\nlower than their zero-shot methods which could be attributed to the potential example bias (Zhao\\net al., 2021; Parmar et al., 2023). RAG improves model performance (∼ 4% and 2% for MuSiQue\\nand StrategyQA respectively.). STEP-BACK PROMPTING with the power of abstraction produces\\nthe best performance of all methods: 42.8% in MuSiQue and 86.4% in StrategyQA, significantly\\noutperforming GPT-4 on both tasks.\\n6.2\\nANALYSIS\\nSimilar to our observation in previous sections, we find that STEP-BACK PROMPTING with RAG is\\nable to turn 15.4% wrong predictions of base model into correct predictions, while leading to 6.1%\\nerrors the other way around. Furthermore, Step-Back + RAG fixes 12.7% errors coming from RAG.\\nThe errors introduced to RAG by Step-Back is just 4.4%.

STEP-BACK PROMPTING breaks\\ncomplex tasks such as knowledge-intensive QA, multi-hop reasoning and science questions into two\\nseparate steps of Abstraction and Reasoning. We demonstrate through empirical experiments that\\nAbstraction is an easy skill to teach the LLMs such as PaLM-2L via sample-efficient demonstrations.\\nGrounding on the high-level concepts and principles, LLMs can leverage their intrinsic Reasoning\\ncapabilities to derive the solution. This reduces the chance of reasoning failures in the intermediate\\nsteps, and is shown to improve the performance on a wide range of complex reasoning tasks. Despite\\nthe success, through error analysis, we find that Reasoning is still one of the hardest skills for LLMs\\nto acquire as it is still the dominating failure mode even after the large chunk of task complexity\\nreduction by STEP-BACK PROMPTING.\\nNevertheless, Abstraction is neither absolutely necessary nor possible in all scenarios. For instance,\\nthe task can be as simple as who was the president of the United States in 2000?, in which case\\nthere is not such a need to step back and ask a high-level question as the answer to such questions is\\nreadily available. Parallelly, questions such as what is the speed of light? point to the first principles\\nthemselves. Doing Abstraction in this case would not make a difference.\\n8\\nRELATED WORK\\nSTEP-BACK PROMPTING is related to the literature of prompting and decomposition.\\n8.1\\nPROMPTING\\nFew-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023; Mishra et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2022b)\\nhas significantly improved model performance across a range of tasks without requiring to update\\nany model parameters. Our work STEP-BACK PROMPTING is in the same category as chain of\\nthought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021) owing to its simplicity and\\ngeneric nature, however, is focused on the key idea of abstraction which is inspired from the fact\\nthat often taking a step back and looking at broader level help humans in performing complex tasks.\\nOur work is also related to the recitation-augmented language models (Sun et al., 2022), however in\\ncontrast to their work, we explicitly perform step-back and abstraction, with optional use of retrieval\\naugmentation depending the nature of the task at hand.\\n8.2\\nDECOMPOSITION\\nDecomposing a task into simpler tasks and solving these tasks to solve the original task have been an\\neffective way (Zhou et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022) to improve\\nmodel performance on complex tasks. Several prompting methods have been successful in improving\\nmodel performance. Our work STEP-BACK PROMPTING, in contrast, is on making the question more\\nabstract and high level, which is different from decomposition that is often low level breakdowns\\nof the original question. Furthermore, abstract questions such as what is the employment history of\\nperson X? are often generic in nature so have a many-to-one mapping since many questions (e.g.\\nwhich employer did X work for in 1990? and which employer did X work for in 2000?) can have the\\nsame abstract questions. This is in contrast to decomposition where there is often a one-to-many\\nmapping since there are multiple decomposed sub-problems necessary to solve a given question.\\n9\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe introduce STEP-BACK PROMPTING as a simple and generic method to elicit deep reasoning via\\nabstraction in large language models. Experimentation on LLMs across fact-seeking, commonsense\\nreasoning and domain specific reasoning benchmark shows STEP-BACK PROMPTING significantly\\nimprove model performance. We hypothesize that abstraction helps models to hallucinate less and\\nreason better, probably reflecting the true nature of the model which are often hidden while responding\\nto the original question without abstraction. We hope our work will inspire more human-inspired\\napproaches to elicit the hidden potential of large language models.\\n9\\n', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'file_path': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'page': 8, 'total_pages': 36, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'modDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models\\nREFERENCES\\nRohan Anil, Andrew M Dai, Orhan Firat, Melvin Johnson, Dmitry Lepikhin, Alexandre Passos,\\nSiamak Shakeri, Emanuel Taropa, Paige Bailey, Zhifeng Chen, et al.

How is this charge distributed on\\nthe sphere?\\n0) The charge is evenly distributed on the surface.\\n1) The charge resides on the surface only; the distribution of charge on the\\nsurface depends on what other charged objects are near the sphere.\\n2) The charge moves continually within the sphere.\\n3) The charge is distributed uniformly throughout the sphere.\\nPrinciples\\nCoulomb’s Law: the force between two charged particles is proportional to the\\nproduct of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance\\nbetween them, F = k * q1 * q2 / r, where F is the electric force, k is a constant,\\nq1 and q2 are the charges the particles carry, and r is the distance between them.\\nAnswer\\nUsing the Principles of Coulomb’s Law, we can solve the problem as following:\\nStep 1: Apply Coulomb’s Law to find out how charges are distributed on the\\nsurface.\\nIn the case of a spherical conductor, the charges on the surface will repel each\\nother. The further apart the charges are, the less force they will exert on each\\nother. Therefore, the charges will distribute themselves evenly on the surface\\nof the sphere, as this is the configuration that minimizes the repulsive force\\nbetween them.\\nStep 2: Apply Coulomb’s Law to find out what happens if there are other\\ncharges present.\\nThe distribution of charge on the surface may also be affected by the presence\\nof other charged objects near the sphere. For example, if a negatively charged\\nobject is brought near a positively charged sphere, the negative charges on the\\nsphere will be repelled and will move to the opposite side of the sphere. This\\nwill result in a non-uniform distribution of charge on the surface of the sphere.\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1) The charge resides on the surface only; the\\ndistribution of charge on the surface depends on what other charged objects are\\nnear the sphere.\\nTable 8: Few-shot demonstration exemplar for MMLU high-school Physics.\\n15\\n', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'file_path': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'page': 14, 'total_pages': 36, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'modDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models\\nQuestion\\nA sample of an unknown chloride compound was dissolved in water, and\\nthen titrated with excess Pb(NO3)2 to create a precipitate.

The molar mass is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).\\nLimiting reactant: The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely con-\\nsumed in a chemical reaction. The amount of product formed is determined by\\nthe amount of limiting reactant.\\nAnswer\\nAssuming the unknown chloride compound is MCl, where M represents the\\nmetal cation, the balanced chemical equation for the precipitation reaction is:\\nPb(NO3)2(aq) + 2MCl(aq) −→ PbCl2(s) + 2MNO3(aq)\\nSince Pb(NO3)2 is in excess, MCl is the limiting reactant. The stoichiometry\\nof the reaction indicates that 2 moles of MCl produce 1 mole of PbCl2\\nprecipitate.

Air resistance is a force\\nthat opposes the motion of an object through the air. It is caused by the friction\\nbetween the object and the air molecules. The greater the surface area of the\\nobject, the greater the air resistance. The tennis ball has a large surface area, so\\nit experiences a lot of air resistance.

Using the\\nformula for capacitors in series, we can find the equivalent capacitance of the\\nthree capacitors:\\n1 / Ceq = 1 / C1 + 1 / C2 + 1 / C3\\n1 / Ceq = 1 / 18 µF + 1 / 18 µF + 1 / 18 µF\\n1 / Ceq = 3 / 18 µF\\nCeq = 6 µF\\nStep 3: Apply Capacitance to find out the charge stored on each capac-\\nitor.\\nWe know that the equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors is 6 µF and the\\nvoltage of the battery is 300 V. Using the formula for capacitance, we can find\\nthe charge stored on each capacitor:\\nC = Q / V\\n6 µF = Q / 300 V\\nQ = 1800 µC\\nTherefore, the charge stored on each capacitor is 1800 µC. The correct\\nanswer is 3) 1800 µC.\\nTable 27: Illustration of wins of STEP-BACK PROMPTING on the MMLU-Physics dataset.\\n32\\n', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'file_path': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'page': 31, 'total_pages': 36, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'modDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models\\ndataset\\nexample\\nMMLU-\\nChemistry\\nOriginal Question: Which of the following indicates that a reaction is\\nspontaneous?\\n0) at equilibrium there are more products than reactants\\n1) the value of ∆G0 is greater than zero\\n2) the value of ∆S0 is greater than zero\\n3) the value of Keq is less than one\\nOriginal Answer [Incorrect]: 2) the value of ∆S° is greater than zero.\\nA reaction is spontaneous if the value of ∆S° is greater than zero. This is\\nbecause a positive ∆S° indicates that the reaction results in an increase in\\nentropy, which is a measure of disorder. A spontaneous reaction is one that\\noccurs without the input of energy, and an increase in entropy is a natural\\ntendency of the universe.\\nStepback Question: What are the chemistry principles behind this question?\\nPrinciples:\\nSpontaneous reactions: A spontaneous reaction is a reaction that occurs without\\nthe input of energy.\\nFinal Answer: A reaction is spontaneous if the change in Gibbs free energy is\\nnegative (∆G < 0). The value of ∆G0 is greater than zero indicates that the\\nreaction is not spontaneous.\\nThe correct answer is 0) at equilibrium there are more products than reactants.\\nMMLU-\\nChemistry\\nOriginal Question: Potassium-40 is a minor isotope found in naturally oc-\\ncurring potassium.

When it is part of K2SO4, it has\\n19 electrons.\\nStepback Question: What are the chemistry principles behind this question?\\nPrinciples:\\nAtomic number: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in\\nthe nucleus of an atom of that element.\\nFinal Answer: The atomic number of potassium is 19, so all potassium atoms\\nhave 19 protons. The mass number of potassium-40 is 40, so it has 40 - 19 =\\n21 neutrons. When potassium is part of a compound, it loses one electron to\\nbecome a potassium ion. Therefore, potassium-40 has 19 - 1 = 18 electrons\\nwhen it is part of K2SO4.\\nThe correct answer is 0) 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons.\\nTable 28: Illustration of wins of STEP-BACK PROMPTING on the MMLU-Chemistry dataset.\\n33\\n', metadata={'source': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'file_path': '/var/folders/pv/2c84c3jx48v8485vx92jq6zc0000gn/T/tmpmdwx6ms6/tmp.pdf?', 'page': 32, 'total_pages': 36, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'modDate': 'D:20231011004213Z', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models\\ndataset\\nexample\\nTimeQA\\nOriginal Question: Carlos Ascues played for which team from 2013 to\\n2014?\\nOriginal Answer [Incorrect]: Carlos Ascues played for Benfica from\\n2013 to 2014.\\nStepback Question: Which teams did Carlos Ascues play for?\\nFinal Answer [Correct]: From 2013 to 2014, Carlos Ascues played for\\nthe Greek team Panetolikos.\\nTimeQA\\nOriginal Question: Seth Nana Twumasi played for which team between\\nJan 2011 and Feb 2011?\\nOriginal Answer [Incorrect]: Seth Nana Twumasi played for the FC\\nHonka team between Jan 2011 and Feb 2011.\\nStepback Question: Which teams did Seth Nana Twumasi play for?\\nFinal Answer [Correct]: Northampton.
