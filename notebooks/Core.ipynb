       " 'raw_content': 'Where the housing market has Morgan Stanley only seeing pain for homebuyers ahead, Zillow keeps cutting its forecast. Here‚Äôs why\\nThe housing market hasn‚Äôt seen a climate like this in a long time‚Äîbut when exactly is a big question. To go by existing home sales, it hasn‚Äôt been this bad since 2010, the depths of the Great Recession, as a 15% collapse in September sent transactions to a 13-year low, a ‚Äúdeep freeze‚Äù that Zillow had warned about back in the spring. Other economists, such as Mark Fleming, chief economist at Fortune 500 financial services firm First American, and Jeseo Park, from Bank of America Research, see conditions that recall the ‚Äúhousing recession‚Äù of the 1980s. Morgan Stanley took the temperature of the market earlier this week and saw just more pain for homebuyers ahead: an up to 5% rise in home prices nationwide, reversing its previous call for prices to fall amid high mortgage rates. Zillow is taking the opposite tack.\\nAfter their February call that U.S. home prices had hit bottom, Zillow economists had been raising their home price forecast each month through August. At that point, they predicted home prices would climb 6.5% over the next 12 months.\\xa0Last month, though, they issued a downward revision. And this month they did it again.\\nZillow economists predicted this week that home prices would rise 2.1% between September 2023 and September 2024. That compares to their prediction last month that home prices would rise 4.9% between August 2023 and August 2024.\\n‚ÄúZillow‚Äôs forecast of the nation‚Äôs typical home value was revised downward this month due to an uncharacteristic month-over-month dip in September and mortgage rates climbing ever higher,‚Äù they wrote this week.\\nZillow economists have come to terms with the likelihood that a resilient labor market will mean a longer-than-expected period of elevated interest rates. With the firming of rates, the housing market has lost some steam.\\n‚ÄúElevated mortgage rates are weighing on new listings with ‚Äòrate-locked‚Äô homeowners largely opting to hold on to the relatively low monthly payment associated with their current home,‚Äù wrote Zillow economists.\\nThey now expect national home prices to rise 3.3% in 2023, down from the 4.3% they predicted last month.\\n‚ÄúWhile many home shoppers are priced out or limited in what they can afford, there are enough active buyers to keep competitive pressure on for the few homes available for sale,‚Äù they noted.\\nMorgan Stanley, for its part, recently made a more dramatic change to its 2023 outlook. While its analysts previously expected home prices to fall for the year, they now say prices could rise by up to 5%. The reversal, made in a research note earlier this week, comes as mortgage rates continue to rise.\\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit 8% this week, according to Mortgage News Daily. Rates haven‚Äôt been this high in decades.\\n‚ÄúIt is likely they will stay around that level‚Ä¶in the last few months of the year, especially if the Fed does raise rates one more time before the year is done,‚Äù Fleming told Fortune this week.\\nThe Fed is keeping open the possibility of further rate hikes. Andrew Levin, a former senior Fed advisor who‚Äôs now a professor at Dartmouth College, recently told Bloomberg: ‚ÄúThere is a very substantial risk that they will need to do more.‚Äù\\nMost popular Finance articles\\n¬© 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.
