       "  'raw_content': 'Articles\\n2024 Housing Market Forecast and Predictions: Housing Affordability Finally Begins to Turnaround\\nAs we look ahead to 2024, we see a mix of continuity and change in both the housing market and economy. Against a backdrop of modest economic growth, slightly higher unemployment, and easing inflation longer term interest rates including mortgage rates begin a slow retreat. The shift from climbing to falling mortgage rates improves housing affordability, but saps some of the urgency home shoppers had previously sensed. Less frenzied housing demand and plenty of rental home options keep home sales relatively stable at low levels in 2024, helping home prices to adjust slightly lower even as the number of for-sale homes continues to dwindle.\\nRealtor.com¬Æ 2024 Forecast for Key Housing Indicators\\nHome Prices Dip, Improving Affordability\\nHome prices grew at a double-digit annual clip for the better part of two years spanning the second half of 2020 through 2022, a notable burst following a growing streak that spanned back to 2012. As mortgage rates climbed, home price growth flatlined, actually declining on an annual basis in early 2023 before an early-year dip in mortgage rates spurred enough buyer demand to reignite competition for still-limited inventory. Home prices began to climb again, and while they did not reach a new monthly peak, on average for the year we expect that the 2023 median home price will slightly exceed the 2022 annual median.\\nNevertheless, even during the brief period when prices eased, using a mortgage to buy a home remained expensive. Since May 2022, purchasing the typical for-sale home listing at the prevailing rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 20% down payment meant forking over a quarter or more of the typical household paycheck. In fact, in October 2023, it required 39% of the typical household income and this share is expected to average 36.7% for the full calendar year in 2023. This figure has typically ranged around 21%, so it is well above historical average. We expect that the return to pricing in line with financing costs will begin in 2024, and home prices, mortgage rates, and income growth will each contribute to the improvement. Home prices are expected to ease slightly, dropping less than 2% for the year on average. Combined with lower mortgage rates and income growth this will improve the home purchase mortgage payment share relative to median income to an average 34.9% in 2024, with the share slipping under 30% by the end of the year.\\nHome Sales Barely Budge Above 2023‚Äôs Likely Record Low\\nAfter soaring during the pandemic, existing home sales were weighed down in the latter half of 2022 as mortgage rates took off, climbing from just over 3% at the start of the year to a peak of more than 7% in the fourth quarter. The reprieve in mortgage rates in early 2023, when they dipped to around 6%, brought some life to home sales, but the renewed climb of mortgage rates has again exerted significant pressure on home sales that is exacerbated by the fact that a greater than usual number of households bought homes over the past few years, and despite stories of pandemic purchase regret, for the most part, these homeowners continue to be happy in their homes.\\nThis is consistent with what visitors to Realtor.com report when asked why they are not planning to sell their homes. The number one reason homeowners aren‚Äôt trying to sell is that they just don‚Äôt need to; concern about losing an existing low-rate mortgage is the top financial concern cited. Our current projection is for 2023 home sales to tally just over 4 million, a dip of 19% over the 2022 5 million total.\\nWith many of the same forces at play heading into 2024, the housing chill will continue, with sales expected to remain essentially unchanged at just over 4 million. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will have a very high threshold for deciding to move, with many likely choosing to stay in place.\\xa0 Moves of necessity‚Äìfor job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market‚Äìare likely to drive home sales in 2024.\\nShoppers Find Even Fewer Existing Homes For Sale\\nEven before the pandemic, housing inventory was on a long, slow downward trajectory. Insufficient building meant that the supply of houses did not keep up with household formation and left little slack in the housing market. Both homeowner and rental vacancy remain below historic averages. In contrast with the existing home market, which remains sluggish, builders have been catching up, with construction remaining near pre-pandemic highs for single-family and hitting record levels for multi-family.\\nDespite this, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been painfully obvious in the for-sale home market. The number of existing homes on the market has dwindled. With home sales activity to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low.\\xa0 Although mortgage rates are expected to begin to ease, they are expected to exceed 6.5% for the calendar year. This means that the lock-in effect, in which the gap between market mortgage rates and the mortgage rates existing homeowners enjoy on their outstanding mortgage, will remain a factor. Roughly two-thirds of outstanding mortgages have a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate less than 6%.\\nRental Supply Outpaces Demand to Drive Mild Further Decline in Rents\\nAfter almost a full year of double-digit rent growth between mid-2021 and mid-2022, the rental market has finally cooled down, as evidenced by the year-over-year decline that started in May 2023. In 2024, we expect the rental market will closely resemble the dynamics witnessed in 2023, as the tug of war between supply and demand results in a mild annual decline of -0.2% in the median asking rent.\\nNew multi-family supply will continue to be a key element shaping the 2024 rental market.\\xa0 In the third quarter of 2023, the annual pace of newly completed multi-family homes stood at 385,000 units. Although absorption rates remained elevated in the second quarter, especially at lower price points, the rental vacancy rate ticked up to 6.6% in the third quarter. This uptick in rental vacancy suggests the recent supply has outpaced demand, but context is important. After recent gains, the rental vacancy rate is on par with its level right before the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, still below its 7.2% average from the 2013 to 2019 period.\\xa0 Looking ahead, the strong construction pipeline‚Äìwhich hit a record high for units under construction this summer‚Äìis expected to continue fueling rental supply growth in 2024 pushing rental vacancy back toward its long-run average.\\nWhile the surge in new multi-family supply gives renters options, the sheer number of renters will minimize the potential price impact. The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level. Renting is expected to continue to be a more budget friendly option than buying in the vast majority of markets, even though home prices and mortgage rates are both expected to dip, helping pull the purchase market down slightly from record unaffordability.\\nYoung adult renters who lack the benefit of historically high home equity to tap into for a home purchase will continue to find the housing market challenging. Specifically, as many Millennials age past first-time home buying age and more Gen Z approach these years, the current housing landscape is likely to keep these households in the rental market for a longer period as they work to save up more money for the growing down payment needed to buy a first home. This trend is expected to sustain robust demand for rental properties. Consequently, we anticipate that rental markets favored by young adults, a list which includes a mix of affordable areas and tech-heavy job markets in the South, Midwest, and West, will be rental markets to watch in 2024.\\nKey Wildcards:\\nHousing Perspectives:\\nWhat will the market be like for homebuyers, especially first-time homebuyers?\\nFirst-time homebuyers will continue to face a challenging housing market in 2024, but there are some green shoots. The record-high share of income required to purchase the median priced home is expected to begin to decline as mortgage rates ease, home prices soften, and incomes grow. In 2023 we expect that for the year as a whole, the monthly cost of financing the typical for-sale home will average more than $2,240, a nearly 20% increase over the mortgage payment in 2022, and roughly double the typical payment for buyers in 2020. This amounted to a whopping nearly 37% of the typical household income. In 2024 as modest price declines take hold and mortgage rates dip, the typical purchase cost is expected to slip just under $2,200 which would amount to nearly 35% of income. While far higher than historically average, this is a significant first step in a buyer-friendly direction.\\nHow can homebuyers prepare?\\nHomebuyers can prepare for this year‚Äôs housing market by getting financially ready. Buyers can use a home affordability calculator, like this one at Realtor.com to translate their income and savings into a home price range. And shoppers can pressure test the results by using a mortgage calculator to consider different down payment, price, and loan scenarios to see how their monthly costs would be impacted. Working with a lender can help potential buyers explore different loan products such as FHA or VA loans that may offer lower mortgage interest rates or more flexible credit criteria.\\nAlthough prices are anticipated to fall in 2024, housing costs remain high, and a down payment can be a big obstacle for buyers. Recent research shows that the typical down payment on a home reached a record high of $30,000.\\xa0 To make it easier to cobble together a down payment, shoppers can access information about down payment assistance options at Realtor.com/fairhousing and in the monthly payment section of home listing pages. Furthermore, home shoppers can explore loan products geared toward helping families access homeownership by enabling down payments as low as 3.5% in the case of FHA loans and 0% in the case of VA loans.\\nWhat will the market be like for home sellers?\\nHome sellers are likely to face more competition from builders than from other sellers in 2024. Because builders are continuing to maintain supply and increasingly adapting to market conditions, they are increasingly focused on lower-priced homes and willing to make price adjustments when needed. As a result, potential sellers will want to consider the landscape for new construction housing in their markets and any implications for pricing and marketing before listing their home for sale.\\nWhat will the market be like for renters?\\nIn 2024, renting is expected to continue to be a more cost-effective option than buying in the short term even though we anticipate the advantage for renting to diminish as home prices and mortgage rates decline.\\nHowever, for those considering the pursuit of long-term equity through homeownership, it‚Äôs essential to not only stay alert about market trends but also to carefully consider the intended duration of residence in their next home. When home prices rise rapidly, like they did during the pandemic, the higher cost of purchasing a home may break even with the cost of renting in as little as 3 years. Generally, it takes longer to reach the breakeven point, typically within a 5 to 7-year timeframe. Importantly, when home prices are falling and rents are also declining, as is expected to be the case in 2024, it can take longer to recoup some of the higher costs of buying a home. Individuals using Realtor.com‚Äôs Rent vs. Buy Calculator can thoroughly evaluate the costs and benefits associated with renting versus buying over time and how many years current market trends suggest it will take before buying is the better financial decision. This comprehensive tool can provide insights tailored to a household‚Äôs specific rent versus buying decision and empowers consumers to consider not only the optimal choice for the current month but also how the trade-offs evolve over several years.\\nLocal Market Predictions:\\nAll real estate is local and while the national trends are instructive, what matters most is what‚Äôs expected in your local market.\\nMetro\\n2024 Sales Growth % y/y\\n2024 Price Growth % y/y\\nSign up for updates\\nJoin our mailing list to receive the latest data and research.'},\n",

High home prices and elevated mortgage rates have posed challenges for numerous potential buyers, leaving them wondering, ‚ÄúWill home prices drop in 2024?‚Äù As the holidays and colder weather approach, now is an opportune time to reflect on the state of the housing market and look ahead to hopefully more favorable conditions for buyers next year.\\nThat begs several questions: Is it a good time to buy a house in the coming months? When will mortgage rates drop? Will the housing supply improve? For answers, we reached out to several real estate and mortgage industry pros, requesting their housing market predictions.\\nIn this article:\\nNational housing market trends and stats\\nOver the past year, the real estate market has navigated through a challenging landscape. With fluctuating home prices, elevated mortgage rates, and a range of economic factors, prospective buyers, sellers, and investors have had to adapt to a dynamic environment.\\nHere‚Äôs what we know about the national real estate market, based on the latest data from the National Association of Realtors, Redfin, Freddie Mac, and The Mortgage Reports:\\nBut raw numbers don‚Äôt tell the whole story. For a more in-depth analysis of how we got here, perspectives on where the national housing market stands, and predictions on where interest rates, prices, inventory, and other key indicators are headed, we reached out to a variety of industry experts. Their insights and prognostications are shared below.\\nCurrent housing market overview\\nFor a bird‚Äôs eye view of the real estate climate, we first asked the pros to sum up the current state of the U.S. housing market.\\nRick Sharga, president/CEO of CJ Patrick Company: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd characterize the housing market today as boring and likely to stay pretty unexciting for the foreseeable future. Existing home sales are on pace to be at their lowest total since 2009, during the Great Recession. Prices have rebounded over the past few months, and are increasing on a year-over-year basis, but very modestly (1-2%). Inventory is inching up slightly from nearly historic lows, but still down between 40-50% from the same time in 2019, when we last had a relatively normal number of homes for sale. And mortgage rates continue to rise, discouraging homeowners with lower-rate mortgages from listing their homes for sale and making a home purchase unaffordable for more buyers.‚Äù\\nShri Ganeshram, CEO of Awning.com: ‚ÄúThe national real estate market presents a mixed bag of scenarios. On one hand, home prices have seen a steady climb, reflecting both the increased demand and the undeniable value people place on homeownership. Mortgage rates, while still low historically, have risen in recent months, causing some hesitations among potential home buyers. Inventory levels have been somewhat tight, especially in sought-after areas, driving up competition. Sales volumes have been robust, but with the occasional plateau, indicative of market saturation in specific areas. Home buyer interest remains high, but I‚Äôve noticed a slight trend toward more informed and cautious buying. Remember when everyone was in a rush to get their slice of suburbia in the early 2020s? There‚Äôs more of a wait-and-watch sentiment now.‚Äù\\nJoseph Melara, owner of Residential Brokers: ‚ÄúThe national real estate market is experiencing several noteworthy trends. Firstly, we‚Äôve observed a slight decline in home prices on a national level. This is in line with seasonal patterns and is not indicative of a long-term trend. Additionally, mortgage rates have been rising as a measure to stabilize inflation, which is impacting buyer affordability. Inventory levels have continued to decrease, largely because many current homeowners are holding onto their properties due to lower interest rates, resulting in reduced housing mobility. Sales volumes have declined proportionally in both the detached and attached markets, aligning with the seasonal dip in prices. However, despite these fluctuations, it‚Äôs important to note that the market remains relatively stable.‚Äù\\nRalph DiBugnara, president of Home Qualified: ‚ÄúThe current real estate market is one we have never seen before, with a combination of higher interest rates, high inflation, and lack of homes for sale to meet the demand of potential buyers. But buyers, even those willing to pay high prices, are less likely to follow through on purchasing a home if it is in disrepair. That‚Äôs the difference from when payments, rates, and inflation were lower. At the increased cost across the board, buyers want a better finished product.‚Äù\\nNick Ron, owner/founder/CEO of House Buyers of America: ‚ÄúMarket activity is cooling due to eye-popping home prices and interest rates. But even though the national average 30-year mortgage rate has jumped to a nearly 23-year high, buyer interest remains relatively high and the housing market is still competitive for prospective buyers.‚Äù\\nWill home prices drop in 2024?\\nThe outlook for home prices in 2024 varies among experts. While some anticipate a potential drop of 5-10% due to factors like softening demand, affordability issues, and economic uncertainty, others predict rising prices, driven by continued high demand and low supply. Factors such as local market conditions, employment trends, and regional dynamics will play a significant role in determining the direction of home prices.\\nAndrew Lokenauth, owner of BeFluentInFinance: ‚ÄúHome prices will likely drop 5-10% nationally in 2024 as demand softens further. Affordability issues, economic uncertainty, and moderating investor activity will weigh on prices. Of course, the exact amount prices will reduce will depend on local market conditions and employment trends.‚Äù\\nJeremy Schachter, branch manager with Fairway Independent Mortgage: ‚ÄúHome prices will rise in 2024. With the demand still being high and supply low, this will drive up home values, especially if rates come down, which will increase demand even more.‚Äù\\nGlenn Phillips, CEO of Lake Homes Realty: ‚ÄúHousing prices nationally will level off on an average basis, with some markets slightly rising, some dropping, all based on local demand and that local demand‚Äôs local economic conditions.‚Äù\\nRon: ‚ÄúI expect house prices to rise around 3% to 4%. But at some point in 2024, I see a slowdown in price growth. The slowdown will be due to a combination of factors such as rising interest rates, an increase in the supply of homes, a decrease in demand, and affordability challenges for buyers. That said, I‚Äôm not anticipating a drop in prices nationwide. Rising construction costs and a slowing economy as a result of prolonged high interest rates will also impact the housing market in 2024.\\nGaneshram: ‚ÄúGiven the current trajectory and economic indicators, I anticipate a moderate rise in housing prices nationally. The reason is consistent demand, especially in suburban and exurban regions. The urban exodus, sparked by remote work trends, hasn‚Äôt entirely plateaued. Add to that the narrative of some of my peers in the real estate industry: Many of them anticipate new housing developments in 2024, which could initially moderate prices. But expect prices overall to rise as supply tries to catch up with demand.‚Äù\\nSharga: ‚ÄúHome prices will probably rise slightly in 2024, perhaps by 2-3% as demand continues to outpace supply. However, this will not be universally true; some formerly high-flying markets like the Bay Area in California, Austin, and Phoenix could see prices continue to fall, while cities in the Southeastern states may see prices rise more quickly.‚Äù\\nMelara: ‚ÄúI anticipate that national housing prices will continue to experience a mild drop in 2024. This decline is expected to be a result of seasonal fluctuations, similar to what we‚Äôve seen historically.‚Äù\\nWill mortgage rates come down?\\nThe outlook for mortgage rates in 2024 continues to be a subject of debate among experts. While some predict a slight decline in mortgage rates, others expect them to remain relatively high, influenced by economic factors, inflation, and Federal Reserve policy. This uncertainty leaves both buyers and sellers cautiously monitoring the mortgage rate landscape throughout the year.\\nDiBugnara: ‚ÄúMortgage rates, on average, will be down in 2024 compared to 2023. But I do not believe they will drop as low as previously predicted by forecasters. An average interest rate in the mid 6% range for a 30-year fixed-rate loan is where I believe we will land.‚Äù\\nRon: ‚ÄúSometime in the first half of next year we will see slightly lower, but still elevated, mortgage rates. As the economy decelerates, rates should go down. At some point in 2024, the Fed will start lowering rates as they see inflation decline and unemployment increase. Rates will still be high enough that home buyers continue to be challenged by affordability, and sellers will still be reluctant to give up their low existing mortgage rates.‚Äù\\nSharga: ‚ÄúMortgage rates are likely to decline, slowly but steadily, over the year. This decline should begin once the Federal Reserve confirms that it‚Äôs done raising the Fed Funds rate for this cycle. But borrowers shouldn‚Äôt expect to see mortgage loans with 4% interest rates; it‚Äôs more likely that rates will gradually work their way down from 7%, and possibly end next year just below 6%.‚Äù\\nLokenauth: ‚ÄúRates could fluctuate in 2024 based on inflation and Fed policy, but I expect rates to average in the 5-7% range. A strong labor market and slowing inflation could lead to rate cuts in the second half of 2024, but higher rates of at least 6% seem likely to persist throughout 2024.‚Äù\\nWill housing inventory increase?\\nWhile some experts anticipate a modest home inventory increase due to factors like rising interest rates and market dynamics, others argue that new construction may lag, maintaining tight inventory levels. However, one consensus remains: the housing market‚Äôs supply-demand balance continues to be a focal point for homeowners and prospective buyers alike.\\nHere‚Äôs what some mortgage pros had to say:\\nPhillips: ‚ÄúSupply will rise slightly in 2024. The reasons? Those who have been postponing selling‚Äîespecially because they don‚Äôt want to give up their current low mortgage rates‚Äîmay finally need to move, plus natural market churn will occur. However, no drastic change will flood the market with inventory, and buyer demand will remain strong in 2024.‚Äù\\nLokenauth: ‚ÄúSupply will gradually rise in 2024 as profit margins drop and sellers are less rushed. But new construction is lagging, keeping inventory tight for the long term. I expect to see 5-10% more listings nationally in 2024.‚Äù\\nSharga: ‚ÄúNew home inventory is likely to increase a little bit next year as home builders ramp up activity to meet market demand; but the inventory of existing homes for sale will probably be flat as homeowners remain locked in by low interest rates on their current mortgages. Almost 70% of mortgage loans today have an interest rate of 4% or lower. We‚Äôre unlikely to see many of those homeowners list their properties for sale until rates drop significantly, probably to 5.5% or lower.‚Äù\\nRon: ‚ÄúI see some increases in housing inventory in 2024 due to rising interest rates, affordability challenges for buyers, and a decrease in demand. But in general, the national housing shortage will continue through the end of the 2020s. Due to the estimated pent-up demand for housing, it will take time for the nation‚Äôs builders to find suitable land, skilled labor, and materials to create a much-needed supply. Innovation in regulatory technology can also help increase the supply of housing and make it easier to build new homes faster.‚Äù\\nMelara: ‚ÄúHousing inventory is anticipated to continue its decline into 2024. The primary factor contributing to this trend is the reluctance of existing homeowners to sell. This reluctance to move is reducing the overall supply of homes.‚Äù\\nWill 2024 be a buyer's or a seller's market?\\nWhile some experts anticipate a continuation of a strong seller‚Äôs market due to high demand and limited inventory, others suggest a gradual shift towards a more balanced market, giving buyers slightly more leverage. The outcome may vary by region and housing conditions, making it crucial for both buyers and sellers to stay informed and adaptable in the evolving real estate landscape.\\nHere are the insights shared by some of the experts we interviewed:\\nSharga: ‚Äú2024 will remain a strong seller‚Äôs market unless mortgage interest rates drop much further and faster than most economists are predicting. The market still has strong, demographically driven demand as millions of millennials approach the prime age for buying a home, and there simply isn‚Äôt enough inventory to meet this demand. So in most markets, sellers will continue to be in the driver‚Äôs seat.‚Äù\\nLokenauth: ‚ÄúThe advantage will shift toward buyers in 2024, as they will benefit from more options and negotiating power. However, markets lacking inventory may still favor sellers.‚Äù\\nDiBugnara: ‚Äú2024 will continue to be the year of the seller. Homes have record equity available, but a lot of owners still have very low mortgage interest rates and no desire to join the madness of today‚Äôs market to buy. Inventory will not get to a point that allows a buyers‚Äô market to materialize.‚Äù\\nGaneshram: ‚ÄúA pendulum always swings, doesn‚Äôt it? While 2023 seemed dominantly to be a seller‚Äôs market, 2024 might bring a shift. With the predicted rise in inventory, buyers might have a little more leverage than before. But don‚Äôt expect a full swing ‚Äì it‚Äôll be more of a balanced market, in my opinion.‚Äù\\nRon: ‚ÄúIt will be a seller‚Äôs market in 2024 because of the national housing shortage expected through the end of the 2020s. I expect to see more buyers join with friends and family members to purchase homes, as intergenerational households, grown children boomeranging homes, and families created from friendships increasingly pool multiple income sources to purchase homes and avoid the uncertainty of housing costs as renters.‚Äù\\nWill the housing market crash?\\nInterested in understanding which areas pose a higher risk for real estate investments and which ones are safer to purchase in the coming year? According to data from ATTOM, the top 10 U.S. counties that currently present the lowest risk of experiencing declines in the housing market are:\\nMeanwhile, although it didn‚Äôt provide a full ranked list, ATTOM recently revealed that the most at-risk markets (for declines, based on home affordability, foreclosures, and other measures) in the country right now include New York City (with eight of the top 50 most vulnerable counties in the nation), Chicago (six counties), and Philadelphia (three counties). Another six counties were found throughout northern, central, and southern California, and most of the remaining 50 counties were in Indiana and along the East Coast.\\nIs the fact that so many key markets are susceptible to price drops and foreclosures a sign that a housing crash could be on the horizon for 2024? Here‚Äôs what our panel had to say:\\nSchachter: ‚ÄúThere will not be a housing recession or market crash. Overall, inventory is the biggest reason. For instance, in the Phoenix metro area, there were, on average, 40,000 to 50,000 homes on the market back in 2008 versus 8,000 to 10,000 homes today. Fifteen years later, our population has also increased.‚Äù\\nGaneshram: ‚ÄúBased on current indicators, I don‚Äôt foresee a housing market crash in 2024. However, a mild correction or plateauing of prices in certain regions is possible. Awning.com data indicates that markets like San Francisco and New York City have shown volatility, making them riskier bets in 2024. On the safer side, mid-sized cities such as Boise, Idaho, and Madison, Wisconsin, offer stable growth and lesser fluctuations.‚Äù\\nSharga: ‚ÄúI expect to see home sales remain weak over the next year, probably on par with this year‚Äôs projected sales of about 4 million existing homes and 650,000 new homes, one of the lowest numbers in years due to low inventory and poor affordability. The supply/demand imbalance should prevent a price crash, though a few markets may continue to see prices correct slightly.‚Äù\\nLokenauth: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt foresee a 2008-style crash next year, given tighter lending standards. But I expect a significant housing slowdown and price correction falling short of a recession. I anticipate the riskiest housing markets in 2024 being Boise, Austin, and Phoenix, and the safest being in the Midwest, South, and smaller metro areas.‚Äù\\nThe bottom line: Is it a good time to buy a house?\\nShould home shoppers claim a home soon or wait things out? Will home prices drop in 2024 enough to make a home purchase a wise choice next year? The experts weighed in.\\nSharga: ‚ÄúBuyers who are waiting for a price crash in housing are very likely going to continue to be disappointed, as prices in most markets next year will either be flat or go up slightly. Waiting for mortgage rates to fall may not be a good strategy, either, as marginally lower rates will probably bring more buyers to the market, increasing demand for limited inventory and causing prices to rise more quickly. So if a buyer finds a home he or she likes and can afford at today‚Äôs prices and mortgage rates, and plans to stay in the property for at least a few years, they‚Äôre probably better off buying now than waiting.‚Äù\\nGaneshram: ‚ÄúIf you find the right property that meets your needs and fits your budget, 2024 could be a great year to invest. Waiting for the perfect moment can sometimes mean missed opportunities. However, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure you‚Äôre making informed decisions. Consider interest rates, your financial stability, and long-term goals before jumping in.‚Äù\\nDiBugnara: ‚ÄúIf the home fits a budget you can afford, it is still a good time to buy today and in 2024. Home prices will increase over the next couple of years, which means as an owner, you will have earned increased equity and growth in your investment.‚Äù\\nFAQs\\nWill there be a housing recession in 2024?\\nNone of the experts we surveyed expect a housing crash or housing recession next year. Market indicators do not point to a real estate bubble waiting to burst, especially comparing key metrics today to the 2008 Great Recession.\\nShould I buy a house in 2024 or wait?\\nWhether or not you should purchase a home will depend on your financial readiness, creditworthiness, ability to qualify for a mortgage loan, job security, and risk tolerance. Mortgage rates and home prices may decrease in the coming months, creating an ideal window for buying; or, they could rise further, making it more difficult to afford a home. To make a more informed decision, consult closely with a trusted Realtor/real estate agent, lending expert, and financial advisor.\\nWill mortgage rates drop in 2024?\\nMost of the professionals we polled agree that mortgage rates should come down next year from their current highs, but much will depend on economic conditions and decisions by the Federal Reserve.\"},\n",

       "  'raw_content': '2024 Housing Market Projections: Where Prices Could Grow Most\\nAmid interest rate volatility over the last few years, the housing market ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù some homeowners with historically low rates, while pricing out others. Even though no one can predict the future, it is possible to forecast the trajectories of housing markets at the local level using relevant data. Such models can help inform potential homeowners if they should buy or wait during the quieter winter months, and inform sellers when to list their home.\\nWith this in mind, SmartAsset used Zillow data to rank the largest 2,000 zip codes by the highest projected home price increases.\\nKey Findings\\nTop 10 Projected Home Value Increases\\n1. Rio Grande City, TX: 78582\\nHome values are expected to increase by 12.3% within the 78582 area code, bringing the average price from $113,368 in July 2023 to a projected $127,312 in July 2024.\\n2. Knoxville, TN: 37920\\nIn the Kimberland Heights section of Knoxville, home values are expected to increase by 9.5% between this summer and next summer. This would bring the average home value up to $310,699, from the current $283,744.\\n3. North Miami, FL: 33161\\nThis area of Miami is projected to see an 8.8% increase in home values by next summer, bringing the typical home value up to $501,725 from $461,145 this year.\\n4. Winston-Salem, NC: 27105\\nHome values in Winston-Salem are forecast to climb 8.7%. That would make the average home value $163,269 by summer 2024, or more than a $13,000 increase from this summer.\\n5. Muskegon, MI: 49442\\nAs of July 31, 2023, home prices in the 49442 area of Muskegon averaged $158,324. This is projected to grow to $171,940 ‚Äì an 8.6% increase ‚Äì by the same time in 2024.\\n6. (tie) North Miami Beach, FL: 33162\\nThe average $443,856 home in 33162 could increase almost $38,000 to $481,584 in just one year if the 8.5% projection holds up.\\n6. (tie) Brownsville, FL: 33142\\nThe 33142 area in Brownsville is also projected to undergo a 8.5% increase in home values. That would bring the average home to $407,316.\\n8. Lenoir, NC: 28645\\nThis summer, a home in 28645 is valued at about $191,000 on average. But, it is projected to increase by 8.4% in the next 12 months, with the average value jumping to $206,894.\\n9. Knoxville, TN: 37918\\nHomes in 37918 are forecast to increase in value by 8.3%, taking the average home from $304,881 to $330,186.\\n10. (tie) Post Falls, ID: 83854\\nWith an 8.2% increase in home values, homes in 83854 would go up from an average of $483,973 to $523,659 in just over one year.\\n10. (tie) Donna, TX: 78537\\nHomes in 78537 also have a projected 8.2% increase in value, but they are a little cheaper:\\xa0 Jumping from $128,844 to $139,409 over the next 12 months.\\nData and Methodology\\nCities were ranked by the largest 12-month home value forecast from Zillow‚Äôs Home Value Forecast (ZHVF) metric for all homes (single-family residence, condos, and co-ops) in the top 2,000 zip codes by size. Value change projections are as of July 31, 2023, for July 31, 2024. Projections were applied to the average home value in each zip code to get the projected average home value.\\nHousing Tips\\nPhoto credit: ¬©iStock/Rasi Bhadramani\\nRecent posts\\nMore from SmartAsset\\nCategories\\nSmartAsset Advisors, LLC (\"SmartAsset\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Insight Technology, is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser.

And as of early November, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 7.69 percent ‚Äî thankfully no longer above 8 percent, but still hovering around 20-year highs.\\nHome prices, mortgage rates and inventory levels will all shape housing affordability in the coming year. Curious where these trends may go? Read on to learn what the experts predict for the 2024 housing market.\\nWhat will happen to the housing market in 2024?\\nRates roughly doubled in 2022, thanks in part to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs war on inflation, and have stayed high since. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, mortgage lenders take cues from them, and mortgage rates climbed in tandem with the Fed‚Äôs long string of rate hikes.\\nWill housing sales decline?\\nWhile home prices have certainly held firm this year, the volume of home sales has softened considerably. Existing-home sales in September 2023 declined to an annual pace of 3.96 million, according to NAR data, which represents a 15.4 percent drop year-over-year. However, these trends may pivot in 2024 if mortgage rates dip.\\n‚ÄúRetreating mortgage rates will bring more buyers and sellers to the market and get Americans moving again,‚Äù says NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. At a NAR conference in November, Yun predicted that sales will rise by as much as 15 percent next year.\\n‚ÄúHousing sales are expected to increase a bit from this year,‚Äù says Chen Zhao, who leads the economics team at Redfin. ‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù she qualifies, ‚Äúwe are not expecting sales to increase dramatically, as rates are likely to remain above 6 percent.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúLower mortgage rates would help spur home sales activity, which are expected to increase in 2024 compared to 2023,‚Äù says Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic. ‚ÄúDeclines in mortgage rates will drive more sellers to trade their existing home and help add much-needed inventory to the market, leading to more transactions.‚Äù\\nWill housing inventory increase?\\nSpeaking of much-needed inventory, housing supply has been very low throughout 2023 thus far. The overall number of existing homes on the market for sale as of September sat at 1.13 million units, an 8.1 percent decline since last year. That figure represents only a 3.4-month supply, far short of the 5 to 6 months usually needed for a balanced market.\\n‚ÄúThere are simply not enough homes for sale,‚Äù Yun said in a statement earlier this year. ‚ÄúThe market can easily absorb a doubling of inventory.‚Äù\\nFor inventory levels to improve significantly, there would need to be either a surge of homeowners listing their existing properties or a huge amount of new-construction homes hitting the market. While both seem relatively unlikely, Yun does foresee some increase in housing inventory for 2024. ‚ÄúThere will be more home construction, and more existing homeowners will be willing to sell and give up their low mortgage rates,‚Äù he says.\\nWill home prices go down?\\nHousing prices have been on fire lately, culminating in historic highs ‚Äî September‚Äôs median of $394,300 was only about $20K short of the highest monthly home price NAR has ever recorded ($413,800, set in June 2022).\\nSo will home prices drop in 2024? Probably not, says Yun: ‚ÄúHome prices will rise around 3 to 4 percent,‚Äù he predicts.\\nPrices are intricately connected with housing inventory, as well, notes Zhao. ‚ÄúSellers are likely to remain reluctant to give up their low interest rate for a much higher one, so inventory will remain constrained,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs more time passes, more homeowners may be ‚Äòforced‚Äô to sell due to life events, so inventory may rise from the current anemic levels, but it‚Äôs unlikely to increase much. That means that prices are unlikely to fall on a year-over-year basis, unless demand falters.‚Äù\\nWill 2024 be a buyer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs market?\\nIn today‚Äôs market, tight inventory gives sellers the upper hand. There are more buyers than there are homes available, so each home that comes on the market becomes more of a hot commodity than it might if there were more options to choose from. Without a significant uptick in inventory, the seller‚Äôs market seems unlikely to change next year.\\n‚ÄúThe current significant shortage of inventory suggests it would be hard to [become] a buyer‚Äôs market anytime soon,‚Äù says Hepp.\\n‚ÄúGiven expectations about interest rates and supply, demand will probably exceed supply similar to current conditions,‚Äù Zhao says. ‚ÄúSupply is likely to remain below what we would deem a balanced market.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúThe plague of low inventory won‚Äôt be cured in the short-term, but demand will suffer from high mortgage rates, bringing about more of a balanced market in 2024,‚Äù says McBride. ‚ÄúSellers may find themselves making concessions on closing costs or rate buydowns more often in 2024, and buyers should be wary of biting off more than can be financially chewed. Home prices are at record highs in most markets, the cost of financing is the highest in more than 20 years and insurance costs are up substantially in many coastal markets. You‚Äôre not getting a bargain, and the willingness to walk away might prove to be a good choice.‚Äù\\nBottom line on the 2024 housing market\\nThe combination of high mortgage rates, steep home prices and low inventory levels are lining up to make the 2024 housing market a challenging one for both buyers and sellers. But if rates cool in 2024, as some experts predict, then market activity should heat up in response.\\nThe complexities of the current conditions mean that, now more than ever, it‚Äôs smart to lean on the guidance of an experienced local real estate agent. If you want to enter the market in 2024, whether as a buyer or a seller, let a pro lead the way for you.\\nFAQs\\nCaret Down\\nCaret Down\\nCaret Down\\nArticle sources\\nWe use primary sources to support our work.

       "  'raw_content': 'Articles\\n2024 Housing Market Forecast and Predictions: Housing Affordability Finally Begins to Turnaround\\nAs we look ahead to 2024, we see a mix of continuity and change in both the housing market and economy. Against a backdrop of modest economic growth, slightly higher unemployment, and easing inflation longer term interest rates including mortgage rates begin a slow retreat. The shift from climbing to falling mortgage rates improves housing affordability, but saps some of the urgency home shoppers had previously sensed. Less frenzied housing demand and plenty of rental home options keep home sales relatively stable at low levels in 2024, helping home prices to adjust slightly lower even as the number of for-sale homes continues to dwindle.\\nRealtor.com¬Æ 2024 Forecast for Key Housing Indicators\\nHome Prices Dip, Improving Affordability\\nHome prices grew at a double-digit annual clip for the better part of two years spanning the second half of 2020 through 2022, a notable burst following a growing streak that spanned back to 2012. As mortgage rates climbed, home price growth flatlined, actually declining on an annual basis in early 2023 before an early-year dip in mortgage rates spurred enough buyer demand to reignite competition for still-limited inventory. Home prices began to climb again, and while they did not reach a new monthly peak, on average for the year we expect that the 2023 median home price will slightly exceed the 2022 annual median.\\nNevertheless, even during the brief period when prices eased, using a mortgage to buy a home remained expensive. Since May 2022, purchasing the typical for-sale home listing at the prevailing rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 20% down payment meant forking over a quarter or more of the typical household paycheck. In fact, in October 2023, it required 39% of the typical household income and this share is expected to average 36.7% for the full calendar year in 2023. This figure has typically ranged around 21%, so it is well above historical average. We expect that the return to pricing in line with financing costs will begin in 2024, and home prices, mortgage rates, and income growth will each contribute to the improvement. Home prices are expected to ease slightly, dropping less than 2% for the year on average. Combined with lower mortgage rates and income growth this will improve the home purchase mortgage payment share relative to median income to an average 34.9% in 2024, with the share slipping under 30% by the end of the year.\\nHome Sales Barely Budge Above 2023‚Äôs Likely Record Low\\nAfter soaring during the pandemic, existing home sales were weighed down in the latter half of 2022 as mortgage rates took off, climbing from just over 3% at the start of the year to a peak of more than 7% in the fourth quarter. The reprieve in mortgage rates in early 2023, when they dipped to around 6%, brought some life to home sales, but the renewed climb of mortgage rates has again exerted significant pressure on home sales that is exacerbated by the fact that a greater than usual number of households bought homes over the past few years, and despite stories of pandemic purchase regret, for the most part, these homeowners continue to be happy in their homes.\\nThis is consistent with what visitors to Realtor.com report when asked why they are not planning to sell their homes. The number one reason homeowners aren‚Äôt trying to sell is that they just don‚Äôt need to; concern about losing an existing low-rate mortgage is the top financial concern cited. Our current projection is for 2023 home sales to tally just over 4 million, a dip of 19% over the 2022 5 million total.\\nWith many of the same forces at play heading into 2024, the housing chill will continue, with sales expected to remain essentially unchanged at just over 4 million. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will have a very high threshold for deciding to move, with many likely choosing to stay in place.\\xa0 Moves of necessity‚Äìfor job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market‚Äìare likely to drive home sales in 2024.\\nShoppers Find Even Fewer Existing Homes For Sale\\nEven before the pandemic, housing inventory was on a long, slow downward trajectory. Insufficient building meant that the supply of houses did not keep up with household formation and left little slack in the housing market. Both homeowner and rental vacancy remain below historic averages. In contrast with the existing home market, which remains sluggish, builders have been catching up, with construction remaining near pre-pandemic highs for single-family and hitting record levels for multi-family.\\nDespite this, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been painfully obvious in the for-sale home market. The number of existing homes on the market has dwindled. With home sales activity to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low.\\xa0 Although mortgage rates are expected to begin to ease, they are expected to exceed 6.5% for the calendar year. This means that the lock-in effect, in which the gap between market mortgage rates and the mortgage rates existing homeowners enjoy on their outstanding mortgage, will remain a factor. Roughly two-thirds of outstanding mortgages have a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate less than 6%.\\nRental Supply Outpaces Demand to Drive Mild Further Decline in Rents\\nAfter almost a full year of double-digit rent growth between mid-2021 and mid-2022, the rental market has finally cooled down, as evidenced by the year-over-year decline that started in May 2023. In 2024, we expect the rental market will closely resemble the dynamics witnessed in 2023, as the tug of war between supply and demand results in a mild annual decline of -0.2% in the median asking rent.\\nNew multi-family supply will continue to be a key element shaping the 2024 rental market.\\xa0 In the third quarter of 2023, the annual pace of newly completed multi-family homes stood at 385,000 units. Although absorption rates remained elevated in the second quarter, especially at lower price points, the rental vacancy rate ticked up to 6.6% in the third quarter. This uptick in rental vacancy suggests the recent supply has outpaced demand, but context is important. After recent gains, the rental vacancy rate is on par with its level right before the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, still below its 7.2% average from the 2013 to 2019 period.\\xa0 Looking ahead, the strong construction pipeline‚Äìwhich hit a record high for units under construction this summer‚Äìis expected to continue fueling rental supply growth in 2024 pushing rental vacancy back toward its long-run average.\\nWhile the surge in new multi-family supply gives renters options, the sheer number of renters will minimize the potential price impact. The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level. Renting is expected to continue to be a more budget friendly option than buying in the vast majority of markets, even though home prices and mortgage rates are both expected to dip, helping pull the purchase market down slightly from record unaffordability.\\nYoung adult renters who lack the benefit of historically high home equity to tap into for a home purchase will continue to find the housing market challenging. Specifically, as many Millennials age past first-time home buying age and more Gen Z approach these years, the current housing landscape is likely to keep these households in the rental market for a longer period as they work to save up more money for the growing down payment needed to buy a first home. This trend is expected to sustain robust demand for rental properties. Consequently, we anticipate that rental markets favored by young adults, a list which includes a mix of affordable areas and tech-heavy job markets in the South, Midwest, and West, will be rental markets to watch in 2024.\\nKey Wildcards:\\nHousing Perspectives:\\nWhat will the market be like for homebuyers, especially first-time homebuyers?\\nFirst-time homebuyers will continue to face a challenging housing market in 2024, but there are some green shoots. The record-high share of income required to purchase the median priced home is expected to begin to decline as mortgage rates ease, home prices soften, and incomes grow. In 2023 we expect that for the year as a whole, the monthly cost of financing the typical for-sale home will average more than $2,240, a nearly 20% increase over the mortgage payment in 2022, and roughly double the typical payment for buyers in 2020. This amounted to a whopping nearly 37% of the typical household income. In 2024 as modest price declines take hold and mortgage rates dip, the typical purchase cost is expected to slip just under $2,200 which would amount to nearly 35% of income. While far higher than historically average, this is a significant first step in a buyer-friendly direction.\\nHow can homebuyers prepare?\\nHomebuyers can prepare for this year‚Äôs housing market by getting financially ready. Buyers can use a home affordability calculator, like this one at Realtor.com to translate their income and savings into a home price range. And shoppers can pressure test the results by using a mortgage calculator to consider different down payment, price, and loan scenarios to see how their monthly costs would be impacted. Working with a lender can help potential buyers explore different loan products such as FHA or VA loans that may offer lower mortgage interest rates or more flexible credit criteria.\\nAlthough prices are anticipated to fall in 2024, housing costs remain high, and a down payment can be a big obstacle for buyers. Recent research shows that the typical down payment on a home reached a record high of $30,000.\\xa0 To make it easier to cobble together a down payment, shoppers can access information about down payment assistance options at Realtor.com/fairhousing and in the monthly payment section of home listing pages. Furthermore, home shoppers can explore loan products geared toward helping families access homeownership by enabling down payments as low as 3.5% in the case of FHA loans and 0% in the case of VA loans.\\nWhat will the market be like for home sellers?\\nHome sellers are likely to face more competition from builders than from other sellers in 2024. Because builders are continuing to maintain supply and increasingly adapting to market conditions, they are increasingly focused on lower-priced homes and willing to make price adjustments when needed. As a result, potential sellers will want to consider the landscape for new construction housing in their markets and any implications for pricing and marketing before listing their home for sale.\\nWhat will the market be like for renters?\\nIn 2024, renting is expected to continue to be a more cost-effective option than buying in the short term even though we anticipate the advantage for renting to diminish as home prices and mortgage rates decline.\\nHowever, for those considering the pursuit of long-term equity through homeownership, it‚Äôs essential to not only stay alert about market trends but also to carefully consider the intended duration of residence in their next home. When home prices rise rapidly, like they did during the pandemic, the higher cost of purchasing a home may break even with the cost of renting in as little as 3 years. Generally, it takes longer to reach the breakeven point, typically within a 5 to 7-year timeframe. Importantly, when home prices are falling and rents are also declining, as is expected to be the case in 2024, it can take longer to recoup some of the higher costs of buying a home. Individuals using Realtor.com‚Äôs Rent vs. Buy Calculator can thoroughly evaluate the costs and benefits associated with renting versus buying over time and how many years current market trends suggest it will take before buying is the better financial decision. This comprehensive tool can provide insights tailored to a household‚Äôs specific rent versus buying decision and empowers consumers to consider not only the optimal choice for the current month but also how the trade-offs evolve over several years.\\nLocal Market Predictions:\\nAll real estate is local and while the national trends are instructive, what matters most is what‚Äôs expected in your local market.\\nMetro\\n2024 Sales Growth % y/y\\n2024 Price Growth % y/y\\nSign up for updates\\nJoin our mailing list to receive the latest data and research.'},\n",

       "  'raw_content': 'Jump to\\nFrom affordability to property demand, here are Zillow\\'s 6 biggest predictions for the US housing market in 2024\\nHigh mortgage rates, low inventory, and elevated home prices have defined the US housing market in 2023.\\nThose conditions have kept many current homeowners from moving, hesitant to give up the lower mortgage rates they secured in prior years, which in turn has left prospective buyers with fewer homes to choose from.\\nThe result has been a frozen housing market. Buyers aren\\'t buying because sellers aren\\'t selling, and vice versa. It\\'s led to stubbornly high prices amid mortgage rates that are high in relation to recent history, a cocktail that\\'s created an affordability crisis in US housing.\\nBut things may be looking up next year, Zillow researchers say, and Americans may see some relief as the calendar changes.\\nHere are six predictions the real-estate group has for 2024.\\n1. Higher-for-longer interest rates will lead to more homes on the market\\nAs house hunters and current owners come to terms with the new normal of high mortgage rates, Zillow expects more homes to go up for sale as people lose patience waiting for rates to fall before jumping back into the market.\\nA growing share of reluctant homeowners who haven\\'t sold homes in the last two years could give in to listing their properties, which ultimately could lead to a greater supply of housing.\\n2. Home-buying costs will level off\\nAs of October, a typical homebuyer would have spent more than 40% of their earnings on a mortgage payment, an all-time high indicated by Zillow data going back to the 1990s.\\nHomes may not get less expensive, but the rate of growth could level off and provide Americans some time to catch up via wages and savings.\\n\"Predicting how mortgage rates will move is a nearly impossible task, but recent inflation news gives the impression that rates are likely to hold fairly steady as well in the coming months,\" Zillow researchers said. \"Taken together, the cost of buying a home looks to be on track to level off next year, with the possibility of costs falling if mortgage rates do.\"\\n3. Higher demand for single-family rentals\\nZillow expects demand for single-family rentals to ramp up next year as families seek out affordable options.\\n\"One possible path to more single-family rental inventory is homeowners deciding to turn their home into an investment property and rent it out rather than selling it when they move,\" researchers said. \"The ultralow mortgage rates held by many existing homeowners make it more likely that this option would pencil out.\"\\n4. More markets will follow New York City\\'s lead\\nIn New York City, demand has jumped for rentals in commutable areas with access to downtown and midtown Manhattan. More distant areas, meanwhile, have seen less demand.\\nIn 2024, Zillow expects more markets across the country to reflect growing rental demand in downtown centers.\\n\"Renters looking for a place near downtown will likely have more options with this year\\'s multi-family-construction boom, which means a huge number of new homes have hit the market,\" the real-estate group said.\\n5. Less competition from flippers\\nLow housing inventory has been the norm for years, and even as more homes go online next year, total volume is set to remain below pre-pandemic norms.\\nGiven fewer options, buyers are expected to be willing to overlook small flaws in properties, such as an outdated kitchen, and make the purchase anyway.\\n\"The higher cost of buying a home today makes a flip harder to pencil out, so buyers may face less competition from flippers than they might have in previous years,\" Zillow researchers said. \"Even with less chance of being subject to a bidding war, these homes won\\'t come cheap, so expect buyers to frequent their local hardware stores as they work on DIY home improvements.\"\\n6. AI comes to the housing industry\\nFurther advancements in artificial intelligence will help streamline the home-shopping and home-selling experience next year, Zillow says.\\nNew tools are expected to help real-estate agents connect with more clients, and large language models such as ChatGPT have already helped with writing listings. Zillow\\'s tech experts expect new AI tools to bolster visual content creation, such as 3D images.\\nHome shoppers, meanwhile, are set to benefit from generative-AI-powered experiences that provide more insights into home financing.\\nRead next\\nIndices\\nCommodities\\nCurrencies\\nStocks'},\n",

While home shoppers shouldn‚Äôt expect major relief from today‚Äôs crushing homeownership costs, small gains in affordability are expected to help some buyers get a foot in the door.\\nRenters can also look forward to somewhat better conditions as new construction hits the market in the coming months.\\nFind Your Actual Rate at Rocket Mortgage (NMLS #3030) Today!\\nWhat will the housing market look like in 2024?\\nThis year was another rough one for homebuyers thanks to stubbornly high prices and rising interest rates, which kept many current homeowners locked into their current mortgages. Soaring home insurance costs throughout 2023 also worsened the outlook for buyers, many of whom were forced to hold back on making a purchase or back out of deals.\\nNow that inflation is easing, mortgage rates are expected to make a slow decline throughout 2024. But the wheels of progress turn slowly: Realtor.com experts are forecasting that rates will be 6.8% on average for 2024 and 6.5% by the year‚Äôs end. (For comparison, the average mortgage rate between 2013 and 2019 was about 4%, and they reached a high of 7.79% earlier this year.)\\nAs for home prices, Realtor.com expects the typical monthly purchase cost for the median priced home listing to drop slightly from this year‚Äôs $2,240 to $2,200, amounting to about 35% of the average U.S. household income. Demand will probably remain low, and inventory will still be limited as would-be sellers hold back.\\n‚ÄúMoves of necessity ‚Äî for job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market ‚Äî are likely to drive home sales in 2024,‚Äù Danielle Hale, Realtor.com‚Äôs chief economist, said in the report.\\nOn the whole, while Realtor.com expects record-high unaffordability to wane, Americans shouldn‚Äôt anticipate a return to pre-inflation, pre-pandemic norms in 2024. And if inflation ticks back up, home sales could suffer even more, upending any prospective market stabilization.\\nThere is, however, something of a silver lining for renters in 2024: An increase in new construction is expected to hit the market and give renters more options. That said, the fact that renting will still be more affordable than buying will also mean more competition for rentals. Realtor.com doesn‚Äôt expect rent prices to budge much ‚Äî the median rent price for 2024 is forecasted to decrease only about .2% below this year‚Äôs.\\nWhat can help homebuyers in 2024?\\nThough affordability will still be a challenge for the foreseeable future, free tools like a mortgage payment calculator can help prospective buyers figure out the best options for their needs in terms of loans, down payment and home price. Exploring different loan products with mortgage lenders may also help buyers find lower rates or less stringent loan requirements.\\nAlthough the average down payment reached a record high of $30,000 this year, there are an estimated 2,000-plus down payment assistance (or DPA) programs available throughout the country. DPA programs can be especially beneficial for first-time buyers and are typically designed to meet the needs of local homebuyers.\\nHomebuyers can start by researching DPAs in their desired state, county and city and reaching out to providers about their qualification requirements. Working with a housing counselor, which every lender has available, can help buyers explore the programs that best suit them.\\nNewsletterMoney MovesEvery Saturday, Money dives deep into the world of real estate, offering a fresh take on the latest housing news for homeowners, buyers and daydreamers alike.Sign UpBy clicking \"Sign Up\" I agree to receive newsletters and promotions from Money and its partners.

And as of early November, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 7.69 percent ‚Äî thankfully no longer above 8 percent, but still hovering around 20-year highs.\\nHome prices, mortgage rates and inventory levels will all shape housing affordability in the coming year. Curious where these trends may go? Read on to learn what the experts predict for the 2024 housing market.\\nWhat will happen to the housing market in 2024?\\nRates roughly doubled in 2022, thanks in part to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs war on inflation, and have stayed high since. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, mortgage lenders take cues from them, and mortgage rates climbed in tandem with the Fed‚Äôs long string of rate hikes.\\nWill housing sales decline?\\nWhile home prices have certainly held firm this year, the volume of home sales has softened considerably. Existing-home sales in September 2023 declined to an annual pace of 3.96 million, according to NAR data, which represents a 15.4 percent drop year-over-year. However, these trends may pivot in 2024 if mortgage rates dip.\\n‚ÄúRetreating mortgage rates will bring more buyers and sellers to the market and get Americans moving again,‚Äù says NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. At a NAR conference in November, Yun predicted that sales will rise by as much as 15 percent next year.\\n‚ÄúHousing sales are expected to increase a bit from this year,‚Äù says Chen Zhao, who leads the economics team at Redfin. ‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù she qualifies, ‚Äúwe are not expecting sales to increase dramatically, as rates are likely to remain above 6 percent.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúLower mortgage rates would help spur home sales activity, which are expected to increase in 2024 compared to 2023,‚Äù says Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic. ‚ÄúDeclines in mortgage rates will drive more sellers to trade their existing home and help add much-needed inventory to the market, leading to more transactions.‚Äù\\nWill housing inventory increase?\\nSpeaking of much-needed inventory, housing supply has been very low throughout 2023 thus far. The overall number of existing homes on the market for sale as of September sat at 1.13 million units, an 8.1 percent decline since last year. That figure represents only a 3.4-month supply, far short of the 5 to 6 months usually needed for a balanced market.\\n‚ÄúThere are simply not enough homes for sale,‚Äù Yun said in a statement earlier this year. ‚ÄúThe market can easily absorb a doubling of inventory.‚Äù\\nFor inventory levels to improve significantly, there would need to be either a surge of homeowners listing their existing properties or a huge amount of new-construction homes hitting the market. While both seem relatively unlikely, Yun does foresee some increase in housing inventory for 2024. ‚ÄúThere will be more home construction, and more existing homeowners will be willing to sell and give up their low mortgage rates,‚Äù he says.\\nWill home prices go down?\\nHousing prices have been on fire lately, culminating in historic highs ‚Äî September‚Äôs median of $394,300 was only about $20K short of the highest monthly home price NAR has ever recorded ($413,800, set in June 2022).\\nSo will home prices drop in 2024? Probably not, says Yun: ‚ÄúHome prices will rise around 3 to 4 percent,‚Äù he predicts.\\nPrices are intricately connected with housing inventory, as well, notes Zhao. ‚ÄúSellers are likely to remain reluctant to give up their low interest rate for a much higher one, so inventory will remain constrained,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs more time passes, more homeowners may be ‚Äòforced‚Äô to sell due to life events, so inventory may rise from the current anemic levels, but it‚Äôs unlikely to increase much. That means that prices are unlikely to fall on a year-over-year basis, unless demand falters.‚Äù\\nWill 2024 be a buyer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs market?\\nIn today‚Äôs market, tight inventory gives sellers the upper hand. There are more buyers than there are homes available, so each home that comes on the market becomes more of a hot commodity than it might if there were more options to choose from. Without a significant uptick in inventory, the seller‚Äôs market seems unlikely to change next year.\\n‚ÄúThe current significant shortage of inventory suggests it would be hard to [become] a buyer‚Äôs market anytime soon,‚Äù says Hepp.\\n‚ÄúGiven expectations about interest rates and supply, demand will probably exceed supply similar to current conditions,‚Äù Zhao says. ‚ÄúSupply is likely to remain below what we would deem a balanced market.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúThe plague of low inventory won‚Äôt be cured in the short-term, but demand will suffer from high mortgage rates, bringing about more of a balanced market in 2024,‚Äù says McBride. ‚ÄúSellers may find themselves making concessions on closing costs or rate buydowns more often in 2024, and buyers should be wary of biting off more than can be financially chewed. Home prices are at record highs in most markets, the cost of financing is the highest in more than 20 years and insurance costs are up substantially in many coastal markets. You‚Äôre not getting a bargain, and the willingness to walk away might prove to be a good choice.‚Äù\\nBottom line on the 2024 housing market\\nThe combination of high mortgage rates, steep home prices and low inventory levels are lining up to make the 2024 housing market a challenging one for both buyers and sellers. But if rates cool in 2024, as some experts predict, then market activity should heat up in response.\\nThe complexities of the current conditions mean that, now more than ever, it‚Äôs smart to lean on the guidance of an experienced local real estate agent. If you want to enter the market in 2024, whether as a buyer or a seller, let a pro lead the way for you.\\nFAQs\\nCaret Down\\nCaret Down\\nCaret Down\\nArticle sources\\nWe use primary sources to support our work.

Against a backdrop of modest economic growth, slightly higher unemployment, and easing inflation longer term interest rates including mortgage rates begin a slow retreat. The shift from climbing to falling mortgage rates improves housing affordability, but saps some of the urgency home shoppers had previously sensed. Less frenzied housing demand and plenty of rental home options keep home sales relatively stable at low levels in 2024, helping home prices to adjust slightly lower even as the number of for-sale homes continues to dwindle.\\nRealtor.com¬Æ 2024 Forecast for Key Housing Indicators\\nHome Prices Dip, Improving Affordability', metadata={'url': 'https://www.realtor.com/research/2024-national-housing-forecast/'}),\n",
