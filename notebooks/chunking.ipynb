Start with a new or existing retirement account\\nOne way to begin investing is through a retirement account. Open or access an individual retirement account, or IRA, through a brokerage account. Then choose investments that are aligned with your goals.\\nIf you already have a retirement account through your employer, it's generally a good idea to contribute to that 401(k) first — and qualify for the company match — before you start funding your IRA.

Read How to Invest at Any Life Stage\\n2. Buy-and-hold investing\\nIt’s always nice when things have a clear label, and you can’t get much clearer than “buy and hold.” Buy-and-hold strategists seek investments they believe will perform well over many years. The idea is to not get rattled when the market dips or drops in the short term, but to hold onto your investments and stay the course. Buy-and-hold works only if investors believe in their investment’s long-term potential through those short-term declines.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",

But once this initial work is done, holding investments saves time you would have spent trading, and often beats the returns of more-active trading strategies.\\n» Want to know more? Dive into details on buy-and-hold investment strategy\\n3. Active investing\\nActive investors prefer trading more frequently and opportunistically to capitalize on market fluctuations. Stock traders may use technical analysis, the study of past market data such as trading volume or price trends, to help anticipate where market prices might go.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Active trading includes different strategies based upon pricing, such as swing or spread trading, and can also include momentum and event-driven strategies. Momentum investing seeks to identify and follow trends currently in favor to profit off of market sentiment. Event-driven investing strategies attempt to capture pricing differences during corporate changes and events, such as during mergers and acquisitions, or a distressed company filing for bankruptcy.\\n» To time or not to time? Learn more about market timing\\n4. Dollar-cost averaging\\nThe biggest challenge to timing the markets is getting it right on a consistent basis. For those investors wary of trying their luck on market timing but still wanting a good entry point into the market, the strategy of dollar-cost averaging may appeal.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Investors who dollar-cost average their way into the market spread their stock or fund purchases out over time, buying the same amount at regular intervals. Doing so helps to \"smooth\" out the purchase price over time as you purchase more shares when the stock price is down and buy less shares when the stock price is up. Over time, you gain a better average entry price and reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio.\\n5. Index investing\\nWhile there are active and passive approaches to investing, there are also active and passive investments themselves when deciding between various types of funds. Investors frequently use mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to populate their investment portfolio because funds provide access to a collection of securities, generally stocks and bonds, through one vehicle. Funds allow investors to benefit from diversification, spreading investment risk across many securities to help balance volatility.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"» Learn more: What are ETFs?\\nActive funds employ a portfolio or fund manager to handpick certain investments to populate the fund based upon proprietary research, analysis and forecasts. The manager's goal is to outperform the fund's corresponding index or benchmark. Passive funds, such as index funds and most ETFs, simply mimic an underlying index, providing the investor with similar performance to that particular index.\\nSome mutual funds have high expense ratios or high minimum investments (or both). But investors can often sidestep the highest of such costs by comparison shopping among mutual funds, or by favoring index funds and ETFs, which tend to offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Given the lower cost of passive funds and the arduous task of beating the benchmark facing portfolio managers, index or passive investing often delivers better overall returns over time.\\n6. Growth investing\", metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"6. Growth investing\\nGrowth investing involves buying shares of emerging companies that appear poised to grow at an above-average pace in the future. Companies like this often offer a unique product or service that competitors can't easily duplicate. While growth stocks are far from a sure thing, their allure is that they might grow in value much faster than established stocks if the underlying business takes off. Growth investors are willing to pay a premium price for these stocks in exchange for their robust future growth potential.\\nNew technologies often fall into this category. For example, if someone believes that home buyers are going to shift increasingly from banks to online mortgage lenders with a streamlined application process, they might invest in the lender they believe will become dominant in that market.\", metadata={'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}),\n",

By purchasing what they believe to be undervalued stocks with strong long-term prospects, value investors aim to reap the rewards when the companies achieve their true potential in the years ahead. Value investing usually requires a pretty active hand, someone who is willing to watch the market and news for clues on which stocks are undervalued at any given time.\\nThink about it like this: A value investor might scoop up shares of a historically successful car company when its stock price drops following the release of an awful new model, so long as the investor feels the new model was a fluke and that the company will bounce back over time.\\n» Grow your investment.

Income investing\\nInvestment strategies can help investors achieve a particular aim; for instance, producing a steady income stream.

If you’re saving for a down payment on a house, you may want to place those savings in a more stable environment, like CDs or a high-yield savings account.

Learn more about mutual funds.\\nReal estate: Real estate is a way to diversify your investment portfolio outside of the traditional mix of stocks and bonds. It doesn't necessarily mean buying a home or becoming a landlord — you can invest in REITs, which are like mutual funds for real estate, or through online real estate investing platforms, which pool investor money.\\nIf you have a high risk tolerance, a long time horizon and can stomach volatility, you may want a portfolio that contains mostly stocks or stock funds. If you have a low risk tolerance, you may want a portfolio that has more bonds, since these tend to be more stable and less volatile.\\nYour goals are important in shaping your portfolio, too. For long-term goals, your portfolio can be more aggressive and take more risks — potentially leading to higher returns — so you may opt to own more stocks than bonds.\\nWhichever route you choose, the best way to reach your long-term financial goals and minimize risk is to spread your money across a range of asset classes. That’s called asset diversification, and the proportion of dollars you put into each asset class is called asset allocation. Then within each asset class, you’ll also want to diversify into multiple investments.\\nAsset diversification means owning a range of assets across a variety of industries, company sizes and geographic areas. It's important because different asset classes — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate — respond to the market differently. When one is up, another can be down. So deciding on the right mix will help your portfolio weather changing markets on the journey toward achieving your goals.\\nAsset allocation is the percentage of dollars you put into each asset class. For example, let’s say based on your risk tolerance, time horizon and goals you’ve decided to allocate 90 percent of your money into stocks and 10 percent into bonds. Your asset allocation is 90/10. Within the 90 percent invested into stocks, you should diversify between large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, international stocks or value stocks.\\nBuilding a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and bonds takes time and expertise, so most investors benefit from fund investing. Index funds and ETFs are typically low-cost and easy to manage, as it may take only four or five funds to build adequate diversification.\\nMore resources on investing\\nNow you know the investing basics, and you have some money you want to invest.

NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments.\\nThe best investment strategies increase the money investors make and decrease their exposure to risk.\\nThe strategy will vary depending on your end investment goal and its timeframe, your risk tolerance and how involved you want to be in choosing individual investments.\\nMany investors combine multiple strategies to find the best personalized strategy to fit their situation.\\nWhat\\'s an investment strategy?\\nAn investment strategy is a way of thinking that shapes how you select the investments in your portfolio. The best strategies should help you meet your financial goals and grow your wealth while maintaining a level of risk that lets you sleep at night. The strategy you choose may influence everything from what types of assets you have to how you approach buying and selling those assets.\\nIf you\\'re ready to start investing, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself some basic questions: What are your goals? How much time until you retire? How comfortable are you with risk? Do you know how much you want to invest in stocks, bonds or an alternative?\\nThis is where investment strategies come into play.\\nCharles Schwab\\nInteractive Brokers IBKR Lite\\nWebull\\n4.9\\n5.0\\n4.7\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nGet up to 12 free fractional shares (valued up to $3,000)\\nwhen you open and fund an account with Webull.\\n9 popular investment strategies\\nThere are numerous ways to approach investing, and here are some of the more popular investing strategies to consider.\\n1. Start with a new or existing retirement account\\nOne way to begin investing is through a retirement account. Open or access an individual retirement account, or IRA, through a brokerage account. Then choose investments that are aligned with your goals.\\nIf you already have a retirement account through your employer, it\\'s generally a good idea to contribute to that 401(k) first — and qualify for the company match — before you start funding your IRA. Employer match programs are free money you don\\'t want to leave on the table.\\nHowever, you should know that most 401(k)s offer relatively few investment choices, so the options for strategy within those vehicles are usually limited. Whereas IRAs give you access to a more expansive world of investments than your 401(k) may offer.\\nYou can also trade through a brokerage account for long-term goals other than retirement.\\n» Need more direction? Read How to Invest at Any Life Stage\\n2. Buy-and-hold investing\\nIt’s always nice when things have a clear label, and you can’t get much clearer than “buy and hold.” Buy-and-hold strategists seek investments they believe will perform well over many years. The idea is to not get rattled when the market dips or drops in the short term, but to hold onto your investments and stay the course. Buy-and-hold works only if investors believe in their investment’s long-term potential through those short-term declines.\\nThis strategy requires investors to carefully evaluate their investments — whether they are broad index funds or a rising young stock — for their long-term growth prospects upfront. But once this initial work is done, holding investments saves time you would have spent trading, and often beats the returns of more-active trading strategies.\\n» Want to know more? Dive into details on buy-and-hold investment strategy\\n3. Active investing\\nActive investors prefer trading more frequently and opportunistically to capitalize on market fluctuations. Stock traders may use technical analysis, the study of past market data such as trading volume or price trends, to help anticipate where market prices might go.\\nActive trading includes different strategies based upon pricing, such as swing or spread trading, and can also include momentum and event-driven strategies. Momentum investing seeks to identify and follow trends currently in favor to profit off of market sentiment. Event-driven investing strategies attempt to capture pricing differences during corporate changes and events, such as during mergers and acquisitions, or a distressed company filing for bankruptcy.\\n» To time or not to time? Learn more about market timing\\n4. Dollar-cost averaging\\nThe biggest challenge to timing the markets is getting it right on a consistent basis. For those investors wary of trying their luck on market timing but still wanting a good entry point into the market, the strategy of dollar-cost averaging may appeal.\\nInvestors who dollar-cost average their way into the market spread their stock or fund purchases out over time, buying the same amount at regular intervals. Doing so helps to \"smooth\" out the purchase price over time as you purchase more shares when the stock price is down and buy less shares when the stock price is up. Over time, you gain a better average entry price and reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio.\\n5. Index investing\\nWhile there are active and passive approaches to investing, there are also active and passive investments themselves when deciding between various types of funds. Investors frequently use mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to populate their investment portfolio because funds provide access to a collection of securities, generally stocks and bonds, through one vehicle. Funds allow investors to benefit from diversification, spreading investment risk across many securities to help balance volatility.\\n» Learn more: What are ETFs?\\nActive funds employ a portfolio or fund manager to handpick certain investments to populate the fund based upon proprietary research, analysis and forecasts. The manager\\'s goal is to outperform the fund\\'s corresponding index or benchmark. Passive funds, such as index funds and most ETFs, simply mimic an underlying index, providing the investor with similar performance to that particular index.\\nSome mutual funds have high expense ratios or high minimum investments (or both). But investors can often sidestep the highest of such costs by comparison shopping among mutual funds, or by favoring index funds and ETFs, which tend to offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Given the lower cost of passive funds and the arduous task of beating the benchmark facing portfolio managers, index or passive investing often delivers better overall returns over time.\\n6. Growth investing\\nGrowth investing involves buying shares of emerging companies that appear poised to grow at an above-average pace in the future. Companies like this often offer a unique product or service that competitors can\\'t easily duplicate. While growth stocks are far from a sure thing, their allure is that they might grow in value much faster than established stocks if the underlying business takes off. Growth investors are willing to pay a premium price for these stocks in exchange for their robust future growth potential.\\nNew technologies often fall into this category. For example, if someone believes that home buyers are going to shift increasingly from banks to online mortgage lenders with a streamlined application process, they might invest in the lender they believe will become dominant in that market.\\nInvestors can also look toward burgeoning geographies or companies to find growth. As they industrialize, emerging markets or developing economies usually are more volatile but also grow at a faster pace compared to their more-developed peers. Companies are valued by market capitalization, or market cap, which is calculated by their total outstanding shares available times the market price of the shares. Small-cap stocks, shares of companies usually valued at $2 billion in market cap or less, provide investors with greater potential risk but also greater potential return due to their faster growth trajectory.\\n7. Value investing\\nMade famous by investors such as Warren Buffett, value investing is the bargain shopping of investment strategies. By purchasing what they believe to be undervalued stocks with strong long-term prospects, value investors aim to reap the rewards when the companies achieve their true potential in the years ahead. Value investing usually requires a pretty active hand, someone who is willing to watch the market and news for clues on which stocks are undervalued at any given time.\\nThink about it like this: A value investor might scoop up shares of a historically successful car company when its stock price drops following the release of an awful new model, so long as the investor feels the new model was a fluke and that the company will bounce back over time.\\n» Grow your investment. Compare and contrast growth and value investing\\nValue investing is considered a contrarian strategy because investors are going against the grain or investing in stocks or sectors currently out of favor. A subset of investors take value investing a step further by not just investing in cheaper stocks and sectors but purposely seeking out the cheapest ones out there to invest in so-called deep value.\\n8. Income investing\\nInvestment strategies can help investors achieve a particular aim; for instance, producing a steady income stream. Many investors use income investing to help cover their living expenses particularly when transitioning into retirement.\\nThere are different investments that can produce income, from dividend-paying stocks to bond and CD ladders to real estate.\\n» Learn more: What is a bond\\n9. Socially responsible investing\\nSocial issues such as climate change and racial justice impact lives on a day-to-day basis. Socially responsible investing (SRI) aims to create positive change in society while also generating positive returns. In addition to investment performance, SRI investors look into a company’s business practices and revenue sources to ensure they\\'re aligned with their personal values.\\nSome investors employ SRI by excluding stocks of companies that go against their moral compass; for instance, they might exclude investments in “sin” stocks or tobacco- and alcohol-related companies. Others intentionally direct their investment dollars toward issues they care about, such as into renewable energy companies.\\n» Want an ethical portfolio? Learn more about socially responsible investing\\nPrinciples of investment strategies\\nWhatever investment strategy you choose, it’s important to consider your investing goals. Where your investment style will fall in the following categories depends on many factors: Everything from your age to your finances and even your comfort level doing it yourself will help determine what your portfolio will look like.\\nLong-term goals vs. short-term goals\\nWhen investing for long-term goals — those five years or more in the future — it may make sense to choose higher-yielding (but more volatile) instruments like stocks and stock funds. But there are smart ways to pursue short-term savings goals, too. If you’re saving for a down payment on a house, you may want to place those savings in a more stable environment, like CDs or a high-yield savings account. Since you have a shorter time frame for your money to grow with a goal like this, there is less time to weather the volatility of the stock market.\\n» Saving for the short term? Read about the best short-term investment accounts\\nLong-term savings goals, such as retirement, can handle the fluctuations of the market. Since those investments will be in the market for longer — provided the investor can stay the course when there are major changes in the short term — there is less need to worry about those shorter-term dips. These long-term investments are better served by a mix of stocks and bonds or stock mutual funds.\\nCharles Schwab\\nInteractive Brokers IBKR Lite\\nWebull\\n4.9\\n5.0\\n4.7\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nGet up to 12 free fractional shares (valued up to $3,000)\\nwhen you open and fund an account with Webull.\\nLow-risk vs. high-risk investing strategy\\nInvestment strategies always come with some amount of risk, and in almost every way risk and reward are linked. Investors who pursue higher rewards are usually taking bigger risks. For example, a bank CD is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and has virtually no risk. It also pays very little in return. A young tech startup’s stock, on the other hand, is likely higher-risk, but there is a chance it could explode in value.\\nThere are many shades of risk in between, but whatever path you choose, make sure you’re prepared to deal with them.\\nDo-it-yourself vs. hiring professional help\\nInvestors have many choices when it comes to managing their investment portfolio. How involved do you want to be in the investing process? How much do you already know about investing? Beginner investors may prefer to hand their savings off to a robo-advisor — an automated, low-cost investing service — rather than take on the challenge of making all the choices themselves.\\nMore advanced investors or avid DIYers might opt to take a more active role, whether that means trading every day or just keeping tabs on their portfolios. Active investing can be a lot of work and may not give you higher returns than passive investing strategies.\\nBest Brokerage Accounts for Stock Trading\\nRead more\\nBest Online Stock Brokers for Beginners\\nRead more\\nBest Robo-Advisors\\nRead more\\nDisclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

Read about the best investments right now\\n1. Give your money a goal\\nFiguring out how to invest money starts with determining your investing goals, when you need or want to achieve them and your comfort level with risk for each goal.\\nLong-term goals: These goals are at least five years away. One common goal is retirement, but you may have others as well: Do you want a down payment on a house or college tuition? To purchase your dream vacation home or go on an anniversary trip in 10 years?\\nShort-term goals: These goals are less than five years away. This is next summer's vacation, a house you want to buy next year, an emergency fund or your holiday piggy bank. Money for short-term goals generally shouldn't be invested at all. If you need the money you're saving in under five years, check out our guide to how to invest money for short-term goals.\\nIn this article, we're largely focusing on investing for long-term goals. We'll also touch on how to invest with no specific goal in mind. After all, the aim to grow your money is a fine goal by itself.\\n» Curious about buying stocks? Learn how to invest in the stock market.\\n2. Decide how much help you want\\nOnce you know your goals, you can dive into the specifics about how to invest (from picking the type of account to the best place to open an account to choosing investment vehicles). But if the DIY route doesn't sound like it'll be your cup of tea, no worries.\\nMany savers prefer having someone invest their money for them. And while that used to be a pricey proposition, nowadays you may find it's surprisingly affordable to hire professional help thanks to the advent of automated portfolio management services, a.k.a. robo-advisors.\\nThese online advisors use computer algorithms and advanced software to build and manage a client’s investment portfolio, offering everything from automatic rebalancing to tax optimization and even access to human help when you need it.\\n» Learn more: What is a robo-advisor?\\nIf you'd rather do it yourself, continue reading — we'll take you through the steps.\\n3. Pick an investment account\\nTo buy most types of investments, including stocks and bonds, you'll need an investment account. Just as there are a number of bank accounts for different purposes — checking, savings, money market, certificates of deposit — there are a handful of investment accounts to know about.\\nSome accounts offer tax advantages if you're investing for a specific purpose, like retirement. Keep in mind that you may be taxed or penalized if you pull your money out early, or for a reason not considered qualified by the plan rules. Other accounts are general purpose and should be used for goals not related to retirement — that dream vacation home, the boat to go with it or simply a vacation, period.\\nHere's a list of some of the most popular investing accounts:\\nIf you're investing for retirement:\\n401(k): You might already have a 401(k), which is offered by many employers and takes contributions right from your paycheck. Many companies will match your contributions, up to a limit — if yours does, you should contribute at least enough to earn that match before investing elsewhere.\\nTraditional or Roth IRA: If you're already contributing to a 401(k) or don't have one, you can open an individual retirement account. In a traditional IRA, your contributions are tax-deductible but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. A Roth IRA is a cousin of the traditional version, with the opposite tax treatment: Contributions are made after-tax and do not offer upfront tax-deductibility, but money grows tax-free and distributions in retirement are not taxed. There are also retirement accounts specifically designed for self-employed people.\\n» View our roundup of the best IRA providers\\nIf you're investing for another goal:\\nTaxable account: Sometimes called brokerage or nonqualified accounts, these are flexible investment accounts not earmarked for any specific purpose. Unlike retirement accounts, there are no rules on contribution amounts, and you can take money out at any time. These accounts don't have tax deductibility, but if you're saving for retirement and you've maxed out the above options, you can continue saving in a taxable account.\\nCollege savings accounts: Like retirement accounts, these offer tax perks for saving for college. A 529 account and a Coverdell education savings account are commonly used for college savings.\\nYou can open many types of non-retirement accounts at an online broker.\\n» View our roundup of the best online brokers\\n4. Open your account\\nNow that you know what kind of account you want, you need to choose an account provider. There are two major options:\\nAn online broker will allow you to self-manage your account, buying and selling a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, funds and more complex instruments. An account at an online broker is a good choice for investors who want a large selection of investment options or who prefer to be hands-on with account management. Here's how to open a brokerage account.\\nA robo-advisor in a portfolio management company will use computers to do much of the work for you, building and managing a portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals. You'll pay an annual management fee for the service, generally around 0.25% to 0.50%. Robo-advisors often use funds, so they're generally not a good choice if you're interested in individual stocks or bonds. But they can be ideal for investors who prefer to be hands off.\\nDon't worry if you're just getting started. Often you can open an account with no initial deposit. (See our lineup of best brokers for beginning investors.) Of course, you're not investing until you actually add money to the account, something you'll want to do regularly for the best results. You can set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your investment account, or even directly from your paycheck if your employer allows that.\\n» Curious about buying stocks? Learn how to invest in the stock market.\\nNerd out on investing news\\nSubscribe to our monthly investing newsletter for our nerdy take on the stock market.\\n5. Choose investments that match your tolerance for risk\\nFiguring out how to invest money involves asking where you should invest money. The answer will depend on your goals and willingness to take on more risk in exchange for higher potential investment rewards. Common investments include:\\nStocks: Individual shares (piece of ownership) of companies you believe will increase in value. Learn more about stocks.\\nBonds: Bonds allow a company or government to borrow your money to fund a project or refinance other debt. Bonds are considered fixed-income investments and typically make regular interest payments to investors. The principal is then returned on a set maturity date. Learn more about bonds.\\nMutual funds: Investing your money in funds — like mutual funds, index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)— allows you to purchase many stocks, bonds or other investments all at once. Mutual funds build instant diversification by pooling investor money and using it to buy a basket of investments that align with the fund's stated goal. Funds may be actively managed, with a professional manager selecting the investments used, or they may track an index. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, will hold around 500 of the largest companies in the United States. Learn more about mutual funds.\\nReal estate: Real estate is a way to diversify your investment portfolio outside of the traditional mix of stocks and bonds. It doesn't necessarily mean buying a home or becoming a landlord — you can invest in REITs, which are like mutual funds for real estate, or through online real estate investing platforms, which pool investor money.\\nIf you have a high risk tolerance, a long time horizon and can stomach volatility, you may want a portfolio that contains mostly stocks or stock funds. If you have a low risk tolerance, you may want a portfolio that has more bonds, since these tend to be more stable and less volatile.\\nYour goals are important in shaping your portfolio, too. For long-term goals, your portfolio can be more aggressive and take more risks — potentially leading to higher returns — so you may opt to own more stocks than bonds.\\nWhichever route you choose, the best way to reach your long-term financial goals and minimize risk is to spread your money across a range of asset classes. That’s called asset diversification, and the proportion of dollars you put into each asset class is called asset allocation. Then within each asset class, you’ll also want to diversify into multiple investments.\\nAsset diversification means owning a range of assets across a variety of industries, company sizes and geographic areas. It's important because different asset classes — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate — respond to the market differently. When one is up, another can be down. So deciding on the right mix will help your portfolio weather changing markets on the journey toward achieving your goals.\\nAsset allocation is the percentage of dollars you put into each asset class. For example, let’s say based on your risk tolerance, time horizon and goals you’ve decided to allocate 90 percent of your money into stocks and 10 percent into bonds. Your asset allocation is 90/10. Within the 90 percent invested into stocks, you should diversify between large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, international stocks or value stocks.\\nBuilding a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and bonds takes time and expertise, so most investors benefit from fund investing.

The best strategies should help you meet your financial goals and grow your wealth while maintaining a level of risk that lets you sleep at night. The strategy you choose may influence everything from what types of assets you have to how you approach buying and selling those assets.\\nIf you\\'re ready to start investing, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself some basic questions: What are your goals? How much time until you retire? How comfortable are you with risk? Do you know how much you want to invest in stocks, bonds or an alternative?\\nThis is where investment strategies come into play.\\nCharles Schwab\\nInteractive Brokers IBKR Lite\\nWebull\\n4.9\\n5.0\\n4.7\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nGet up to 12 free fractional shares (valued up to $3,000)\\nwhen you open and fund an account with Webull.\\n9 popular investment strategies\\nThere are numerous ways to approach investing, and here are some of the more popular investing strategies to consider.\\n1. Start with a new or existing retirement account\\nOne way to begin investing is through a retirement account. Open or access an individual retirement account, or IRA, through a brokerage account. Then choose investments that are aligned with your goals.\\nIf you already have a retirement account through your employer, it\\'s generally a good idea to contribute to that 401(k) first — and qualify for the company match — before you start funding your IRA. Employer match programs are free money you don\\'t want to leave on the table.\\nHowever, you should know that most 401(k)s offer relatively few investment choices, so the options for strategy within those vehicles are usually limited. Whereas IRAs give you access to a more expansive world of investments than your 401(k) may offer.\\nYou can also trade through a brokerage account for long-term goals other than retirement.\\n» Need more direction? Read How to Invest at Any Life Stage\\n2. Buy-and-hold investing\\nIt’s always nice when things have a clear label, and you can’t get much clearer than “buy and hold.” Buy-and-hold strategists seek investments they believe will perform well over many years. The idea is to not get rattled when the market dips or drops in the short term, but to hold onto your investments and stay the course. Buy-and-hold works only if investors believe in their investment’s long-term potential through those short-term declines.\\nThis strategy requires investors to carefully evaluate their investments — whether they are broad index funds or a rising young stock — for their long-term growth prospects upfront. But once this initial work is done, holding investments saves time you would have spent trading, and often beats the returns of more-active trading strategies.\\n» Want to know more? Dive into details on buy-and-hold investment strategy\\n3. Active investing\\nActive investors prefer trading more frequently and opportunistically to capitalize on market fluctuations. Stock traders may use technical analysis, the study of past market data such as trading volume or price trends, to help anticipate where market prices might go.\\nActive trading includes different strategies based upon pricing, such as swing or spread trading, and can also include momentum and event-driven strategies. Momentum investing seeks to identify and follow trends currently in favor to profit off of market sentiment. Event-driven investing strategies attempt to capture pricing differences during corporate changes and events, such as during mergers and acquisitions, or a distressed company filing for bankruptcy.\\n» To time or not to time? Learn more about market timing\\n4. Dollar-cost averaging\\nThe biggest challenge to timing the markets is getting it right on a consistent basis. For those investors wary of trying their luck on market timing but still wanting a good entry point into the market, the strategy of dollar-cost averaging may appeal.\\nInvestors who dollar-cost average their way into the market spread their stock or fund purchases out over time, buying the same amount at regular intervals. Doing so helps to \"smooth\" out the purchase price over time as you purchase more shares when the stock price is down and buy less shares when the stock price is up. Over time, you gain a better average entry price and reduce the impact of market volatility on your portfolio.\\n5. Index investing\\nWhile there are active and passive approaches to investing, there are also active and passive investments themselves when deciding between various types of funds. Investors frequently use mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to populate their investment portfolio because funds provide access to a collection of securities, generally stocks and bonds, through one vehicle. Funds allow investors to benefit from diversification, spreading investment risk across many securities to help balance volatility.\\n» Learn more: What are ETFs?\\nActive funds employ a portfolio or fund manager to handpick certain investments to populate the fund based upon proprietary research, analysis and forecasts. The manager\\'s goal is to outperform the fund\\'s corresponding index or benchmark. Passive funds, such as index funds and most ETFs, simply mimic an underlying index, providing the investor with similar performance to that particular index.\\nSome mutual funds have high expense ratios or high minimum investments (or both). But investors can often sidestep the highest of such costs by comparison shopping among mutual funds, or by favoring index funds and ETFs, which tend to offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Given the lower cost of passive funds and the arduous task of beating the benchmark facing portfolio managers, index or passive investing often delivers better overall returns over time.\\n6. Growth investing\\nGrowth investing involves buying shares of emerging companies that appear poised to grow at an above-average pace in the future. Companies like this often offer a unique product or service that competitors can\\'t easily duplicate. While growth stocks are far from a sure thing, their allure is that they might grow in value much faster than established stocks if the underlying business takes off. Growth investors are willing to pay a premium price for these stocks in exchange for their robust future growth potential.\\nNew technologies often fall into this category. For example, if someone believes that home buyers are going to shift increasingly from banks to online mortgage lenders with a streamlined application process, they might invest in the lender they believe will become dominant in that market.\\nInvestors can also look toward burgeoning geographies or companies to find growth. As they industrialize, emerging markets or developing economies usually are more volatile but also grow at a faster pace compared to their more-developed peers. Companies are valued by market capitalization, or market cap, which is calculated by their total outstanding shares available times the market price of the shares. Small-cap stocks, shares of companies usually valued at $2 billion in market cap or less, provide investors with greater potential risk but also greater potential return due to their faster growth trajectory.\\n7. Value investing\\nMade famous by investors such as Warren Buffett, value investing is the bargain shopping of investment strategies. By purchasing what they believe to be undervalued stocks with strong long-term prospects, value investors aim to reap the rewards when the companies achieve their true potential in the years ahead. Value investing usually requires a pretty active hand, someone who is willing to watch the market and news for clues on which stocks are undervalued at any given time.\\nThink about it like this: A value investor might scoop up shares of a historically successful car company when its stock price drops following the release of an awful new model, so long as the investor feels the new model was a fluke and that the company will bounce back over time.\\n» Grow your investment. Compare and contrast growth and value investing\\nValue investing is considered a contrarian strategy because investors are going against the grain or investing in stocks or sectors currently out of favor. A subset of investors take value investing a step further by not just investing in cheaper stocks and sectors but purposely seeking out the cheapest ones out there to invest in so-called deep value.\\n8. Income investing\\nInvestment strategies can help investors achieve a particular aim; for instance, producing a steady income stream. Many investors use income investing to help cover their living expenses particularly when transitioning into retirement.\\nThere are different investments that can produce income, from dividend-paying stocks to bond and CD ladders to real estate.\\n» Learn more: What is a bond\\n9. Socially responsible investing\\nSocial issues such as climate change and racial justice impact lives on a day-to-day basis. Socially responsible investing (SRI) aims to create positive change in society while also generating positive returns. In addition to investment performance, SRI investors look into a company’s business practices and revenue sources to ensure they\\'re aligned with their personal values.\\nSome investors employ SRI by excluding stocks of companies that go against their moral compass; for instance, they might exclude investments in “sin” stocks or tobacco- and alcohol-related companies. Others intentionally direct their investment dollars toward issues they care about, such as into renewable energy companies.\\n» Want an ethical portfolio? Learn more about socially responsible investing\\nPrinciples of investment strategies\\nWhatever investment strategy you choose, it’s important to consider your investing goals. Where your investment style will fall in the following categories depends on many factors: Everything from your age to your finances and even your comfort level doing it yourself will help determine what your portfolio will look like.\\nLong-term goals vs. short-term goals\\nWhen investing for long-term goals — those five years or more in the future — it may make sense to choose higher-yielding (but more volatile) instruments like stocks and stock funds. But there are smart ways to pursue short-term savings goals, too. If you’re saving for a down payment on a house, you may want to place those savings in a more stable environment, like CDs or a high-yield savings account. Since you have a shorter time frame for your money to grow with a goal like this, there is less time to weather the volatility of the stock market.\\n» Saving for the short term? Read about the best short-term investment accounts\\nLong-term savings goals, such as retirement, can handle the fluctuations of the market. Since those investments will be in the market for longer — provided the investor can stay the course when there are major changes in the short term — there is less need to worry about those shorter-term dips. These long-term investments are better served by a mix of stocks and bonds or stock mutual funds.\\nCharles Schwab\\nInteractive Brokers IBKR Lite\\nWebull\\n4.9\\n5.0\\n4.7\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nFees\\n$0\\nper trade\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nAccount minimum\\n$0\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nNone\\nno promotion available at this time\\nPromotion\\nGet up to 12 free fractional shares (valued up to $3,000)\\nwhen you open and fund an account with Webull.\\nLow-risk vs. high-risk investing strategy\\nInvestment strategies always come with some amount of risk, and in almost every way risk and reward are linked. Investors who pursue higher rewards are usually taking bigger risks. For example, a bank CD is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and has virtually no risk. It also pays very little in return. A young tech startup’s stock, on the other hand, is likely higher-risk, but there is a chance it could explode in value.\\nThere are many shades of risk in between, but whatever path you choose, make sure you’re prepared to deal with them.\\nDo-it-yourself vs. hiring professional help\\nInvestors have many choices when it comes to managing their investment portfolio. How involved do you want to be in the investing process? How much do you already know about investing? Beginner investors may prefer to hand their savings off to a robo-advisor — an automated, low-cost investing service — rather than take on the challenge of making all the choices themselves.\\nMore advanced investors or avid DIYers might opt to take a more active role, whether that means trading every day or just keeping tabs on their portfolios. Active investing can be a lot of work and may not give you higher returns than passive investing strategies.\\nBest Brokerage Accounts for Stock Trading\\nRead more\\nBest Online Stock Brokers for Beginners\\nRead more\\nBest Robo-Advisors\\nRead more\\nDisclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

The manager's goal is to outperform the fund's corresponding index or benchmark. Passive funds, such as index funds and most ETFs, simply mimic an underlying index, providing the investor with similar performance to that particular index.\\nSome mutual funds have high expense ratios or high minimum investments (or both). But investors can often sidestep the highest of such costs by comparison shopping among mutual funds, or by favoring index funds and ETFs, which tend to offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Given the lower cost of passive funds and the arduous task of beating the benchmark facing portfolio managers, index or passive investing often delivers better overall returns over time.\\n6.

Mutual funds build instant diversification by pooling investor money and using it to buy a basket of investments that align with the fund's stated goal. Funds may be actively managed, with a professional manager selecting the investments used, or they may track an index. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, will hold around 500 of the largest companies in the United States.

Where your investment style will fall in the following categories depends on many factors: Everything from your age to your finances and even your comfort level doing it yourself will help determine what your portfolio will look like.\\nLong-term goals vs. short-term goals\\nWhen investing for long-term goals — those five years or more in the future — it may make sense to choose higher-yielding (but more volatile) instruments like stocks and stock funds. But there are smart ways to pursue short-term savings goals, too. If you’re saving for a down payment on a house, you may want to place those savings in a more stable environment, like CDs or a high-yield savings account. Since you have a shorter time frame for your money to grow with a goal like this, there is less time to weather the volatility of the stock market.', 'url': 'https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-strategies'}, {'text': \"What's an investment strategy?\\nAn investment strategy is a way of thinking that shapes how you select the investments in your portfolio. The best strategies should help you meet your financial goals and grow your wealth while maintaining a level of risk that lets you sleep at night. The strategy you choose may influence everything from what types of assets you have to how you approach buying and selling those assets.\\nIf you're ready to start investing, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself some basic questions: What are your goals?

But investors can often sidestep the highest of such costs by comparison shopping among mutual funds, or by favoring index funds and ETFs, which tend to offer lower expense ratios than actively managed funds.
